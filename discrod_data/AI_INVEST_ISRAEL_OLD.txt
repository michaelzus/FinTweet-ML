JPMorgan Downgrades $GS to Neutral from Overweight, Raises PT to $750 from $625

Analyst comments: "We see Goldman Sachs shares as fairly valued now. GS has demonstrated strong market share improvement in its Sales and Trading business over the last few years and the franchise has been refocused on its strengths in Global Banking and Markets as well as Asset and Wealth Management. Platform Solutions, which was a topic of much debate for a while, is now mainly the Apple Card and Transaction Banking business with limited contribution (JPMe 5% in 2025E) to Group Revenues.

We also acknowledge the more durable nature of the revenue streams in Investment Banks, something which we had highlighted 5 years back in our report 'Global Investment Banks: The Future of Investment Banking.' However, in a global context, we continue to prefer European IBs Barclays and DBK at significantly cheaper valuations, while for Wealth Management gearing we prefer UBS over MS. We continue with our preference for GS over MS in the U.S."

BofA Earnings Preview for $META (PT $900):

"We expect 3Q revenue/EPS of $50.0bn/$7.30 vs Street $49.5bn/$6.69. Checks suggest potential upside driven by improving macro, accelerating AI benefits, and higher sector ad spend to backfill softer organic Google traffic. We think Street could be expecting 3Q revenue between $50.5–51.0bn. Job data suggests investment continues with 3Q postings up 6% q/q; we estimate 3Q operating margins down 49bps y/y to 42.3%.

For 4Q’25, we estimate revenue/EPS of $58.8bn/$8.90 vs Street $57.3bn/$8.12. Assuming 3Q comes in at the high end of guidance, we expect 4Q guidance of $55.5–59bn (up 15–22% y/y). Given AI build, we expect continued FY25 investments and think Meta could narrow its CY’25 expense range to $115–117bn (from $114–118bn) and raise the low end of Capex range by $2bn to guide to $68–72bn. We expect Meta to formally guide 2026 expenses on the next call while maintaining the outlook for 2026 expense growth to accelerate (higher D&A)."

KeyBanc Initiates Coverage on $HIMS with Sector Weight Rating

Analyst comments: "Hims & Hers is a disruptive direct-to-consumer healthcare business with 2.4 million subscribers as of 2Q25. Hims focuses on personalized care to help customers achieve results, with approximately 1.5 million subscribers on personalized plans. We believe a combination of new treatment launches and international expansion gives Hims ample runway for growth over the coming years.

Investment positives:

1. Established brand;
2. Clear product and geographic expansion opportunities;
3. High gross margin;
4. Feedback loops between treatment and outcomes could create a data and product advantage over time.

Investment negatives:

1. The industry is intensely competitive;
2. Lapping GLP-1 shortages creates tough comps through 1Q26;
3. Both compounding and healthcare marketing practices are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny;
4. Limited history operating in international markets.

Estimates: We project 2025E, 2026E, and 2027E revenue of $2.35B, $2.78B, and $3.34B, respectively. In turn, we project EBITDA of $309M, $390M, and $505M. Given management's focus on delivering more value to subscribers, we expect the company to optimize for subscriber and revenue growth over the coming years while allowing for gradual EBITDA margin expansion."

CoreWeave $CRWV CEO Michael Intrator said the firm won’t raise its $9B all-stock bid for Core Scientific $CORZ, calling it “a nice to have, not a need to have.” 

The deal has been facing growing backlash from shareholders and proxy advisers, including ISS, who say the offer undervalues Core Scientific. 

“We think the bid we put out is fair,” Coreweave CEO said, adding the company will move forward even if the deal is rejected. A shareholder vote is set for Oct 30.

Morgan Stanley Reiterates Overweight Rating on $SPOT, PT $800

Analyst comments: "Having added significant value to its free and Premium tiers, Spotify in our view kicked off a new pricing cycle this Fall and is poised to accelerate growth into next year. We also see AI as a tailwind and move SPOT to Top Pick in Media & Entertainment. We see revenue growth accelerating, upside to consensus EBIT, and are optimistic Spotify can leverage AI into tangible financial benefits in the years ahead.

Spotify continues to add new features and functionality to its Premium tier, and we expect it to follow with a pricing cycle in 2026 that already began in September. Spotify’s recent 14–17% price increases in Australia, in our view, create a template for other bundled markets in 2026, and we expect a U.S. price increase by 1Q26. The recent improvement to its free tier—which includes an hour of on-demand listening—is meaningful and can drive upside to MAU and Premium net adds.

Lowering 4Q25: Price increases announced to date suggest roughly 2% ex-FX ARPU growth in 4Q, lower than prior estimates. We remain in-line with consensus 4Q gross margins."

TD Cowen Downgrades $TEM to Hold from Buy, Raises PT to $88 from $72

Analyst comments: "We are downgrading TEM to Hold as we see the stock more fairly valued following the strong performance (+38% since 9/30 and +160% year-to-date). TEM’s EV/Sales multiple expanded from approximately 7x (at 2Q) to around 11x today despite little fundamental change. Oncology diagnostics peers have also seen strong returns and multiple expansion, though TEM stands out. We raise our price target to $88 from $72, applying an approximately 8x forward EV/Sales multiple."

Wells Fargo Raises $BE PT to $95 from $65 - EW

Analyst comments: "While we’re believers in the behind-the-meter (BTM) market and expect BE to win most fuel-cell orders, the rapid increase in the stock price now reflects shipments well beyond our estimate of the fuel-cell TAM for BTM (~5 GW). BE will need to follow through with significant firm orders to justify the current stock price, introducing downside risk if these announcements do not materialize.

On the flip side, it’s possible we’ve underestimated the BTM TAM—BE could continue to announce additional strategic relationships which could lead to firm orders, potentially further propelling shares. At this juncture, BE is trading on positive momentum as the company has demonstrated a genuine demand for its product for BTM solutions. While we expect a pullback or re-calibration in the share price, the catalyst and timing are less certain. Thus, we remain Equal Weight as we assess what level of firm orders will materialize."

Guggenheim Reiterates Sell Rating on $NET, PT $111

Analyst comments: "We expect Cloudflare to exceed 3Q consensus revenue, but with potentially less upside than the 1H25 beats, and raise FY25 revenue guidance again. Cloudflare’s business momentum has improved over the last two quarters as new ARR growth has accelerated off easy comps. We don’t think the better-than-expected 1H momentum is a factor of an improved IT spending environment, but rather that Cloudflare has expanded its product portfolio capabilities, and CEO/Co-Founder Matthew Prince has brought in talented, well-respected executives.

We believe the hiring and leadership of Mark Anderson as President of Revenue and CJ Desai as Head of Product are beginning to bear fruit, though there is still more work to be done. Cloudflare has been focused on building out a channel presence under the leadership of Tom Evans, a former channel head at PANW. Our field checks this quarter are similar to prior periods—some partners have had success with Cloudflare while others haven’t. Either way, we believe the channel will become a larger percentage of the business over time (vs. 25% in 2Q25).

All that said, Cloudflare continues to innovate and take the right steps, but the premium valuation prices NET shares for perfection (or beyond) and introduces significant risk, in our view. At 32.5x EV/NTM recurring revenue, NET is the most expensive name in our coverage universe and one of the most expensive stocks across broader software. We remain Sell-rated heading into the earnings print, despite what appears to be a relatively favorable numerical setup. Cloudflare reports 3Q25 earnings on Thursday, October 30, after market close."

OpenAI has reportedly hired over 100 former investment bankers from firms like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley for “Project Mercury,” a secret effort to train AI models to automate junior bankers’ grunt work.

Participants are paid $150/hour to build financial models and write prompts for tasks like IPOs and restructurings, with the goal of teaching AI to replicate analysts’ workflows. 

Contractors submit one model per week and receive feedback before integration into OpenAI’s systems.

$PM LIFTS OUTLOOK AFTER STRONG Q3

Philip Morris International raised its 2025 EPS forecast to $7.46–$7.56 adjusted, up from prior guidance of $7.43–$7.56, driven by continued strength in smokeless tobacco products.

Q3 EPS came in at $2.23, up 13% YoY, or $2.24 adjusted vs. $2.09 expected. Revenue rose 9.4% to $10.85B, topping estimates of $10.64B. Smoke-free products now make up 41% of total revenue.

CEO Jacek Olczak said the company’s smoke-free portfolio is “outgrowing the industry by a clear margin,” fueling both volume and margin growth.

$NVDA $AMD $AVGO $ORCL $GOOGL

THE WSJ PUBLISHED A MAJOR STORY LAST NIGHT.

At the core of it, they are reporting that the $100B Nvidia-OpenAI deal came as a result of Sam Altman making Jensen feel that OpenAI was exploring other options.

Remember when The Information reported that OpenAI was thinking of using Google's TPUs? 

A few days later, Nvidia's X account posts a screenshot of a Reuters article denying that OpenAI was going to be using Google?

All of this seemed calculated from Sam to get Jensen to the table to make that $100B investment in them and further intertwine OpenAI's success to Nvidia's success. 

After the deal was made, Sam went on to get deals with $AVGO and $AMD...really making sure he could diversify as much as possible while bringing more companies and their progress into OpenAI's trajectory.

The punchline being...Altman is ruthlessly trying to make sure that if AI ends up being the transformational technology we all think it can become...he is going to be at the center of it.

Essentially, he's trying to make OpenAI too big to fail by making sure that every other important AI company fails if OpenAI does.

Absolutely crazy time to witness this happening in front of us.

$WBD REVIEWING STRATEGIC OPTIONS

Warner Bros. Discovery said its board has begun a review of strategic alternatives after receiving unsolicited takeover interest for the whole company and its Warner Bros division.

Options on the table include a full sale, separate deals for Warner Bros and Discovery Global, or the planned mid-2026 split into two companies.

CEO David Zaslav said the review aims to “unlock full asset value.” No timeline was given for a decision.

froth getting sold off and this guy going green

a bit more calmness coming back to the bull market

again, all those frothy names could go down another 20% and STILL BE UP 2-3x on the year

it’s healthy to see a company that actually has some revenue catch a bid

ADIDAS RAISES 2025 OUTLOOK AFTER STRONG Q3

Adidas reported Q3 revenue of €6.63B, up 12% currency-neutral for the core brand, driven by double-digit growth across all regions and categories. Operating profit rose to €736M with margins improving to 11.1% from 9.3% last year.

The company raised full-year guidance, now expecting around 9% revenue growth and €2B in operating profit, citing strong brand momentum and better-than-expected performance despite higher U.S. tariffs.

$GRAB

Grab price action is a classic example of manipulation/shorts being in control.

The stock was $6+ for a month, had the highest volume ever in September (1B), and now gets stuck in the $5.50s. This is likely due to the short float now going up above 8% and being stuck to the whim of these algos.

The only way to break though...strong earnings. I expect Q3 to be very strong, along with Maybank that has 3-5% higher targets across the board on Grab, but nonetheless price action is of course frustating.

Important to remember the facts during these situations:

- stock is up 20% YTD, beating the S&P

- smart money is loading the boat, 84% of the float is institutional and only increase

- if you are in this long, these are moment to further add vs get scared because some random hype name is going up (as we can see lately, those names are violently losing 20% in a week)

- mgmt has done 7-8 NEW interviews in the last month, first time in over 3 years they are engaging with the media, that is not bearish

- this company, unlike many of the names up 5-8x YTD that are now seeing weakness, has 7B in cash. i will take poor performance being able to sleep at night knowing my company has a massive balance sheet over getting into speculation that has narrative powering it, not a balance sheet

- rates coming down will give a premium to companies that can actually grow

- product innovation is high, multiple new partnerships every month, broadening of their scale across financial services (will do 1B in loans by end of year) and GAAP profitable

Not something to be scared about but rather understand the manipulation is inevitable until a re-rating and if the tutes continue to buy, they also are expecting a change in growth expectations as well.

When flooding struck months later, the same system was redeployed in just 24 hours.

GOLD WORST DAY SINCE 2013 🤯

$100 bucks more and it loses 4,000…

by the way, gold etf inflows over the past 10 weeks was +$34B, $3.4B a week 

the weird part about this rally is that Gold has been going up (anticipating inflation) while the 10-year treasury yield has gone down (anticipating less inflation)

it really hasn’t made much sense, but central banks now have 20% of their reserves which is almost treating gold as good (and liquid) as a 10-yr treasury! 

i am very curious to see if this trade just got overcrowded and needed a breather or if there is some serious selling happening by central banks to either take profits or get back into bonds…

Traders these days spend more time researching companies that:

Have the hottest buzzwords 
Don’t actually have a product yet; Pre-revenue 

Killer PowerPoint & projections for 2050/2100 

Have an IR team ready to drop a PR whenever the chart needs a boost 

Bonus points if they’re flirting with bankruptcy 

The more speculative it is, the better the vibe apparently.

Draftking $DKNG is acquiring predictions platform Railbird, which is licensed by the CFTC to operate an event contracts exchange, per CNBC.

The deal will power DraftKings’ upcoming “DraftKings Predictions” platform, letting users trade outcomes on events in finance, culture, and entertainment, expanding beyond sports betting.

CEO Jason Robins said prediction markets could be a “new opportunity” for the business, combining Railbird’s tech with DraftKings’ scale and mobile expertise. 

The launch is expected in the coming months, focusing on non-sports betting states like California and Texas to avoid regulatory overlap.

U.S. TO OFFER NUCLEAR FIRMS ACCESS TO WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM — FT

The DOE will let nuclear energy companies apply for up to 19 megatonnes of plutonium from Cold War-era warheads to convert into advanced reactor fuel, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on Russian uranium.

Companies like $OKLO (backed by Sam Altman) and France’s Newcleo are expected to apply. The move follows Trump’s executive orders to boost nuclear energy and unlock surplus fuel for SMR developers.

CFO Amy Hood’s total compensation was $29.5 million, and Judson Althoff, who was recently promoted to lead Microsoft’s commercial business, received a package of $28.2M

The Trump administration is preparing a Section 301 trade investigation into whether U.S. trading partners are underpaying for prescription drugs, setting up potential new tariffs on medicines and related goods, per the Financial Times.

Trump has repeatedly argued other countries pay far less for drugs, citing examples like Ozempic, which costs $936/month in the U.S. vs $83 in France, and vowed to “equalize” prices. The probe could lead to broad new trade measures, reigniting tensions with allies in Europe, Canada, and Asia.

The U.S. and India 🇮🇳 are close to finalizing a long-stalled trade agreement that would cut U.S. tariffs on Indian exports to 15–16% from about 50%, according to Mint.

As part of the deal, India may reduce Russian oil imports and open access for non-GMO U.S. corn and soymeal. 

The announcement could come when President Trump and PM Modi meet at the ASEAN Summit in Malaysia (Oct 26–28).

HEINEKEN CUTS 2025 GUIDANCE

Heineken lowered its full-year beer volume forecast and said earnings will come in at the low end of its prior range after weak consumer sentiment and trade uncertainty hit demand in the U.S. and other key markets, per WSJ.

Beer volumes fell 4.3% organically in Q3, with the sharpest declines in the U.S. and Brazil. Revenue came in at €8.71B, down 4% YoY, while adjusted net revenue slipped 0.3% to €7.33B.

The brewer now expects full-year volumes to decline and operating profit growth to land at the low end of its 4–8% guidance. Heineken cited inflation, currency pressure, and weak consumer confidence but said it expects demand to recover once conditions stabilize.

Jaguar Land Rover experienced a major cyberattack in August that shut down its internal systems and halted production for nearly a month, an incident now estimated to have cost the UK around £1.9 billion, making it likely the country’s most economically damaging cyber event.

The attack disrupted operations across more than 5,000 British organizations connected to JLR’s supply chain, prompting the UK government to step in with a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support the carmaker and its partners. 

JLR, owned by Tata Motors, has only recently resumed partial production after the August 31 attack. Investigators believe the financial losses stem from halted vehicle sales, profit declines, recovery expenses, and supply chain effects.

The National Crime Agency is leading the investigation, though few details about the attackers have been released.

We’re 6 months into Trump’s trade war 2.0 with 55% tariffs on China, and China’s still shipping about a billion dollars’ worth of goods to the U.S. every day. 

Exports are down 17% this year, but they’re still pretty much where they were before the pandemic.

Baidu’s $BIDU autonomous ride-hailing arm Apollo Go is partnering with Swiss Post’s PostBus to launch Europe’s 1ST commercial robotaxi service with vehicles that have no steering wheels. 

The new service will be called AmiGo and is scheduled to debut in eastern Switzerland, covering St. Gallen, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, and Appenzell Innerrhoden, with support from Swiss transport authorities.

Testing begins in December 2025 with safety drivers, expanding to select public use in early 2026, and fully driverless operations expected by Q1 2027. 

The service will use Baidu’s Level 4 autonomous RT6 vehicles, which can seat four passengers and support ride-pooling to improve efficiency.

South Korea’s central bank denied reports that it discussed a trilateral currency swap with China and Japan, rejecting claims from SCMP that such talks occurred during the IMF meetings in Washington.

The Bank of Korea said the report was “not true” and confirmed discussions are limited to renewing its bilateral swap with China, worth 400 billion yuan ($56 billion), which expired on October 10. Negotiations for the renewal are said to be “progressing smoothly.”

Needham Initiates Coverage on $TE with Buy Rating, PT $6

Analyst comments: "We initiate on T1 Energy (TE) with a BUY and a $6 PT. TE’s U.S. buildout pairs the fully operational G1 Dallas module plant (5 GW) with the planned G2 Austin cell hub (5 GW, phased), positioning the company to benefit from 45X credits and domestic-content tailwinds.

Equity value is most sensitive to three near-term milestones: G2 financing, FEOC compliance, and 45X monetization. We see improving utilization at G1 (2025 guide 2.6–3.0 GW) and a credible path to vertical integration in 2027, with scenario-weighted upside as TE secures offtakes and converts credits to cash."

Analyst: Sean Milligan

The cuts affect FAIR AI research, product AI, and infrastructure groups but exclude the new TBD Lab, which continues to hire aggressively.

Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang said the move will “reduce bureaucracy” and give remaining employees greater scope and impact. 

Meta is encouraging affected staff to apply for internal roles and expects most to stay within the company.

GE Vernova $GEV CEO said demand for its gas turbines is shifting toward hyperscalers building AI data centers. 

About 10% of current turbine orders come from big tech firms, but one-third of future reservations are from hyperscalers. 

“That starts to illustrate where the market is going,” CEO said. 

Note: Turbines are sold out through 2028, with power orders up 50% to $7.8B and electrification orders up 102% to $5.1B.

$GOOGL UNVEILS QUANTUM COMPUTING BREAKTHROUGH WITH WILLOW CHIP

Google scientists announced a major step toward practical quantum computing with their new “Quantum Echoes” algorithm, published in Nature.

The algorithm, run on Google’s Willow quantum chip, solves problems 13,000× faster than the world’s fastest supercomputer and marks the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage, meaning results can be independently confirmed on another quantum computer.

Google says Quantum Echoes could accelerate breakthroughs in drug discovery, materials science, and molecular modeling, showing the potential for real-world quantum applications after decades of research.

Retail investors are falling for $BYND Pump and Dump following Pump and Dump Accounts. 

Welcome to the stock market. 

Been this way since 1790. 

Speculative stocks selling off is a healthy signal before we get into Q3 earing season(will be strong). 

I said in August/September to get rid of Margin. 

The difference between high quality and speculative?

The high quality businesses will come back and go higher because of strong Revenue/Earning growth, while speculative stocks will just come back with promises/claims. 

See the difference?

Alright, that is it. Be safe out there. 

Not Financial Advice!

the thing about some of these momentum stocks

is that they might not be able to save themselves with a good earnings

because they dont have any...

google could have a bad few months and then have a blowout quarter and change the narrative

what are some of these companies going to say? no backlog, no revenue, no EPS...some of them don't even take shareholder questions!

the worst part of this drawdown for them is that if they don't have anything substantial to say for earnings...and the market already trades at a historically high multiple...what happens when they can't put up any actual results?

Homebuyers are backing out at the highest rate in a year.

About 15% of U.S. home-purchase contracts were canceled in September, up from 13.6% last year, according to Redfin. 

That’s roughly 53,000 deals that fell through, the biggest share since 2023.

Florida and Texas led the nation, with Tampa seeing 20% of contracts canceled as high prices, insurance costs, and inspection issues continue to spook buyers.

Amazon $AMZN just unveiled its most advanced automation tech yet, a multi-armed warehouse robot named Blue Jay and a new AI operations assistant called Project Eluna.

Blue Jay can handle multiple picking and sorting tasks at once, reducing injuries and floor space needs. Project Eluna uses real-time data to help managers prevent gridlock and optimize workflow.

Amazon also showed “Amelia,” AR glasses for delivery drivers with turn-by-turn navigation and barcode scanning, part of its push to shave seconds off every delivery and expand same-day fulfillment.

$GOOGL confirmed it’s the developer behind a $1 Billion, 500-acre data center project in Morgan County, Indiana, ending speculation around the mysterious “Project Louie.”

The Morgan County site, near Monrovia, will feature four data center buildings, powered by a 1,200 MW substation and using about 4M gallons of water daily, per utility filings.

ICYMI: Hermès posted Q3 revenue of €3.88B, up 9.6% year over year, driven by strong demand for its Birkin and Kelly handbags and a rebound in luxury spending across key regions. Sales in the Americas rose 14%, while Asia (ex-Japan) grew 6.4%, led by stabilization in Greater China.

Leather goods led growth with a 13.3% increase, offset by weaker perfume and beauty sales (-7.2%), reflecting softer demand among entry-level luxury consumers. CFO Eric du Halgouët said improving property and stock markets in China have made Hermès “optimistic” about the year-end outlook.

Moderna $MRNA said its phase 3 CMV vaccine trial failed to meet primary efficacy goals, with protection ranging from just 6–23% depending on criteria. 

The company will discontinue development of the CMV vaccine for congenital infection prevention.

The study included 7,500 women across 13 countries and showed a clean safety profile with no major concerns. Moderna will still test the vaccine in bone marrow transplant patients, where CMV reactivation poses risk.

CEO Stéphane Bancel called the outcome “disappointing,” but noted the company’s 2025 guidance and 2028 breakeven target remain unchanged, as CMV wasn’t expected to contribute meaningful near-term revenue.

QuantumScape $QS posted a Q3 EPS loss of ($0.18), beating estimates by $0.02.

The company shipped its first B1 samples of the QSE-5 solid-state battery during the quarter, meeting a key 2025 goal. The cells use the new Cobra separator process and are part of QuantumScape’s Volkswagen Ducati V21L program.

Q3 adjusted EBITDA loss was $61.4M with capex of $9.6M, mainly for its Eagle Line pilot line in San Jose. Full-year EBITDA loss guidance was improved to $245M–$260M, and capex lowered to $30M–$40M.

Liquidity stood at $1B, extending its cash runway through 2030. The company will shift from reporting runway updates to customer billing metrics going forward.

Q3 EPS came in at $1.84, missing consensus of $3.91 by over 50%. Revenue was $11.48B, slightly above estimates but offset by margin compression.

Molina also cut FY25 EPS guidance to ~$14, well below the $18.6 Street forecast, while maintaining FY revenue at ~$44.5B.

$TSLA CEO ON OPTIMUS:

I don't want to downplay the difficulty of Optimus. It's an incredibly difficult thing, especially it's difficult to create a a hand that is as dexterous and capable as the human hand, which is an incredible. The human hand is an incredible thing that the more you study the human hand, the more incredible you realize.

To make a truly useful, generalized robot, you need that incredible hand, real-world AI, and the ability to scale production to car-like volumes,  even higher, ideally. Making just a few hundred robots isn’t relevant.

The real challenge is manufacturing at that scale. There’s no existing supply chain for humanoid robots. Unlike cars or computers, it simply doesn’t exist. Tesla has to go deep into vertical integration and build many of the parts internally.”

Elon Musk confirmed both TSMC and Samsung will build Tesla’s new AI 5 chip, saying he’s been spending “almost every weekend” with the design team and calling it “an incredible chip, by some metrics, 40 times better than A4.”

He explained that $TSLA removed legacy GPU and other redundant components to simplify the architecture and maximize efficiency, claiming A5 could deliver up to 2–3x better performance per watt and up to 10x better performance per dollar than rivals.

Musk added, “I’ve poured so much life energy into this chip,” and said Tesla aims for an oversupply of A5 chips for vehicles, robots, and data centers. Both will be fabricated in TSMC Arizona and Samsung Texas, but he stressed, “We’re not about to replace Nvidia, we’ll continue to use both.”

Grok is “a giant beast of a model” built to solve for AGI, and Grok 5 will only run on $NVDA's GB500. $TSLA's models are much smaller, “maybe 5% the size of Grok,” designed for real-time use in cars.

He added Grok powers voice interaction in Tesla cars and Optimus, but the two AIs serve “opposite ends of the spectrum.”

Elon Musk on the Upcoming Vote on Pay Package:

I want to take a moment to talk about an extremely important vote being held on November 6th. This meeting will shape the future of Tesla, and we’re asking shareholders to support my leadership through the two compensation proposals and the re-election of Ira, Kathleen, and Joe to the board.

Tesla is a team sport, and the board is an essential part of that team. Shareholders are at the center of everything we do. The special committee has proposed what I wouldn’t even call a compensation package, it’s really about ensuring there’s enough voting control to have strong influence, but not so much that I couldn’t be removed if I went insane.

We’ve explored every possible way to achieve increased voting control. Once a company is public, there’s no way to add super-voting stock. Companies like Google and Meta had it before going public, so it was grandfathered in. Tesla doesn’t have that option.

I also want to address a major issue with corporate governance today. A large share of Tesla is owned by passive index funds that vote based on recommendations from Glass Lewis and ISS. These firms have made terrible recommendations in the past that would have been extremely damaging if followed.

If too much of a public company is controlled by index funds, it’s effectively controlled by Glass Lewis and ISS. That’s a fundamental problem because they’re not voting in the best interest of shareholders or the company’s long-term success.

Walmart $WMT is overhauling its merchandising division to speed up decision-making and embed AI and data-driven tools deeper into its operations.

The company cut some corporate roles but is adding 130 new positions, more than offsetting the reductions. The reorganization includes centralizing its strategy and analytics team, creating a new division focused on localizing and opening stores, and adding six “agent builders” to help deploy AI across merchandising workflows.

Leaders wrote that Walmart is “reshaping how we’re organized to realize our people-led, tech-powered ambition.” CEO Doug McMillon recently said AI will transform every job, eliminating some tasks while creating new ones.

Revenue fell 7% YoY to SEK 86.4B, but still topped analyst estimates of SEK 81.3B. EBIT (ex-JVs) rose 10% to SEK 6.3B.

The company said tariffs and price competition remain key challenges, even as sales returned to growth in September after six months of declines.

Tesla supplier STMicroelectronics $STM reported Q3 revenue of $3.19B (-2% YoY; +15% QoQ), slightly above estimates, but net profit dropped to $237M from $351M as demand for auto and industrial chips remains weak.

The European chipmaker expects FY25 sales around $11.75B (vs $13.27B in 2024) and Q4 revenue near $3.28B, hinting a slower recovery in legacy chip markets despite strong AI-related demand.

STMicro also plans to cut capex to under $2B and continue 5,000 workforce reductions by 2027, adapting to tariffs and uneven global chip demand.

Nokia $NOK reported strong Q3 results with a 28% jump in network infrastructure sales, driven by surging demand from AI and data-center customers in North America.

The Finnish telecom-equipment maker said AI and cloud clients made up ~6% of total revenue, underscoring a shift toward data infrastructure as mobile network sales dipped 0.6%. CEO Justin Hotard called AI “a tremendous supercycle,” noting Nokia is in the early innings of a major data-center buildout.

Revenue rose to €4.83B, above estimates, while comparable net profit fell 8% to €323M. Nokia slightly raised full-year profit guidance to €1.7–2.2B, citing a stronger Q4 backlog.

AI-backed creative studio Wonder Studios, supported by executives from OpenAI and Google DeepMind, raised $12M in seed funding to scale AI-driven content production.

The round was led by Atomico, with participation from LocalGlobe, Blackbird, and Adobe Ventures. 

CEO Xavier Collins said AI is “lowering the barriers to Hollywood production,” blending machine intelligence with traditional storytelling.

The funds will double its engineering team and accelerate its push into IP ownership and original content. Wonder Studios uses AI for commercial work, IP partnerships, and film production, with its first projects set to debut next year.

Lloyds Banking Group $LLOY beat Q3 estimates despite a hit from its car-loan redress program.

Net interest income rose 7% YoY to £3.45B, while total net income reached £4.64B, both above forecasts. Pretax profit fell 36% to £1.17B due to a £800M provision for car-loan compensation costs, bringing total reserves to £1.95B.

The bank’s net interest margin improved to 3.06%, up from 2.95% last year, supported by its structural hedge that benefits from lower rates.

JPMorgan Upgrades $LC to Overweight from Neutral, Raises PT to $22 from $17

Analyst comments: "3Q25 originations and pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) came in comfortably ahead of JPMorgan and Street estimates, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) reaching approximately 13%, the highest level in three years, helped by a growing held-for-sale (HFS) portfolio, which generates solid day-one profitability and should ultimately lead to better loan sale economics over time.

Fundamentally, loan buyer demand remains strong as LC announced another $1 billion funding agreement with BlackRock, and increased marketing efforts are far from optimized but already bearing fruit, which is especially encouraging. Looking ahead, the company has more ways than ever to grow originations and profits without incurring punitive CECL charges, which should fuel accelerating profit growth and improved return metrics in 2026 and beyond.

As such, we are moving to Overweight from Neutral and increasing our Dec-26 PT to $22 from $17, and look to the Nov 5th Investor Day as the next positive catalyst."

Analyst comments: "With increasing activity and commentary around voting against the deal, we now assume no CORZ–CRWV deal and no renegotiation. CoreWeave called its bid 'best/final,' and the fixed-ratio spread has inverted. We pivot to a standalone CORZ that leases its power pipeline primarily for high-performance computing (HPC). We are thus raising CORZ to Buy with a $23.50 PT (from $17) on a mix of discounted net present value (NPV) to its CRWV lease, approximately 700MW of uncontracted power and its remaining Bitcoin (BTC) power, as well as weighting for recent $/watt M&A transactions."

Intel’s $INTC next-gen Panther Lake chips are showing real muscle in early benchmarks. 

The Core Ultra X7 358H, spotted on an Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, delivered a 25% graphics uplift versus Arrow Lake-H, hitting ~53K OpenCL points on Geekbench.

Built on Intel’s new 18A process (with RibbonFET and PowerVia tech), Panther Lake marks Intel’s first U.S.-made consumer chip from its Fab 52 in Arizona. Production is underway, with full launch slated for early 2026.

Intel says the architecture offers 50% faster CPU performance than Lunar Lake and 40% better efficiency than Arrow Lake, while integrated Xe3 graphics now rival Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Mobile, a big leap for Intel’s iGPU game.

Goldman Sachs Reiterates Buy Rating on $LRCX, PT $160

Analyst comments: "We expect the stock to be range bound following a quarter and guidance that were ahead of the Street. We believe investor expectations had increased heading into the call given AI-related datacenter announcements, solid peer reports from ASML and others, and strong price action.

We were encouraged by management's constructive commentary on 2026 wafer fab equipment (WFE), with growth expected across all segments, although we believe stock price action could be tempered by muted expectations around China and gross margin headwinds. We remain Buy rated as we believe Lam is positioned to outperform peers given its high relative exposure to deposition and etch, where intensity should increase, and its strong share of NAND equipment upgrades. As NAND suppliers focus on upgrading existing equipment, Lam will benefit disproportionately as that market recovers, supported by the company's leadership in high-bandwidth memory (HBM)."

Barclays Reiterates Equalweight Rating on $TSLA, PT $350

Analyst comments: "While the Tesla call delivered few incremental updates on these topics, we were reminded of Elon’s characterization of the inflection point ahead for Tesla as it doubles down on its mission of sustainable abundance driven by real-world AI. Tesla continues to work to fully validate the opportunities ahead for both Robotaxi and Optimus. We believe the path over the next year is ambitious, and we view the opportunity as a show-me story.

If Tesla can successfully remove the safety rider from its Robotaxi (guided in Austin by year-end) and demonstrate with Optimus V3 (forthcoming in 2026) that it is manufacturable and can improve productivity for owners, these could be key steps in validating the narrative.

As for the fundamentals, the auto gross margin miss was somewhat of a surprise, but we believe higher operating expenses will be overlooked. We were surprised to hear Elon discuss plans to increase production, especially given potential risks to demand following the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit. We see volume rising only modestly next year, with margins likely to deteriorate year-over-year; our 2026 EPS estimate of $1.54 is significantly below consensus of $2.40. Yet we believe it is increasingly understood that this does not matter to investors."

Mizuho Downgrades $ENPH to Neutral from Outperform, Lowers PT to $37 from $50

Analyst comments: "We downgrade Enphase to Neutral and reduce our price target by 26% to $37. Our downgrade reflects reduced residential solar demand in 2026, lower solar market share due to lease switching, limited visibility into the success of a new lease-plus-loan financing model for smaller installers, and limited cost declines from IQ9 technology adoption, which are confined to the commercial market.

Market share loss in 2026 is partially offset by safe harbor demand pull, which adds approximately $1 per share in net present value. We estimate over $200 million of safe harbor orders in mid-2026 for project completions in 2029–2030. We expect a Q3 beat due to safe harbor sales and a Q4 guidance miss versus consensus due to channel inventory slowing ahead of the tax credit step down."

Despite these headwinds, we maintain our Buy rating on IBM, as we believe the company is on track to complete its pivot to long-term growth fueled by improving Software performance and sustained market share gains in Consulting.

Jefferies analyst Jeff Kim cautious on $MU Micron’s HBM4 roadmap, keeping Samsung as his top pick in the memory sector and ranking SK Hynix #2.

He said Micron may be “late to the HBM4 party”, noting engineering sources indicate the company must redesign its metal layer and wiring to achieve meaningful volume at 11 Gbps. 

He believes that process could take 6 to 9 months, limiting Micron’s near-term output and forcing some 2026 capacity toward server DRAM instead.

He also warned that Micron’s current HBM4 yield and volume remain weak, despite management’s claims of 11 Gbps performance on its latest call. He expects HBM4 prices to rise as supply tightens and Micron’s redesign delays constrain capacity.

Overall, Jefferies views Samsung as best positioned to capture HBM4 share at scale, while Micron might face execution risk and may cede early-cycle advantage to Samsung and SK Hynix.

Russian oil flows to India are expected to drop to almost zero after the US sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, cutting off India’s main supply route for discounted Russian crude. 

Russia has been India’s largest oil source since 2023, accounting for roughly 36% of imports this year.

Indian refiners said transactions involving the two companies must be wound down by Nov. 21, forcing them to pivot back to Middle East suppliers.

$PLUG Power said it deployed hydrogen fuel cell systems at Floor & Decor’s distribution center in Frederickson, Washington. The setup powers 77 pieces of equipment, marking the retailer’s first zero-emission material handling fleet.

The system includes a 10,000-gallon liquid hydrogen tank, vaporizers, compressors, and a high-capacity dispenser, eliminating over 400 metric tons of CO₂ annually, equal to avoiding about 45,000 gallons of gasoline. The installation also captures and reuses around 300 liters of water per day for facility operations.

BofA Securities Upgrades $ZION to Neutral from Underperform, Raises PT to $62 from $59

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading ZION to Neutral from Underperform. We believe the current valuation discount to its pre-pandemic average (–19% based on our 2026E) captures above-trend credit risk but overlooks the bank’s tangible book value (TBV) growth prospects of 15% versus the 10% peer average.

While last week’s fraud-related loan writedown reflects poorly on ZION’s risk management, we do not believe it indicates systemic issues or undermines the progress management has made since the Global Financial Crisis. We are raising our price objective to $62 from $59 following an upward revision to 2026E."

The Pentagon has funded a joint development effort between NioCorp $NB and Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division to create a scandium-based defense technology. 

The program, backed by the Department of War under a $10 million Defense Production Act Title III award, will focus on producing aluminum-scandium alloy components for next-generation fighter aircraft.

NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said the partnership will help establish a domestic scandium supply chain through the company’s Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska, which aims to produce about 100 tonnes of scandium oxide per year. 

Lockheed Martin said the initiative connects U.S. critical mineral mining to advanced materials for national defense applications.

Kratos $KTOS received a $68.3M Department of War contract to build a hypersonic materials testing facility under the IBAS program.

The project, dubbed Project Helios, will integrate a 20–25 MW arc jet and a 200 kW fiber laser for testing thermal protection systems on hypersonic vehicles — filling critical U.S. testing infrastructure gaps.

CEO Eric DeMarco said the facility will “advance hypersonic technology development while alleviating the current testing bottleneck.” Kratos SRE, with 80 years of high-temp materials expertise, will partner with North Wind and New Horizon 5 for design.

The company expects the facility to boost testing throughput and cut program costs, supporting all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

The tool uses large language models and AWS services like Bedrock, SageMaker, and OpenSearch to explain why a specific product is right for you.

Available in the U.S. on the Amazon app and web, the feature expands Amazon’s growing suite of AI shopping tools, following last year’s Rufus assistant and this year’s Lens Live visual search.

Piper Sandler Raises $PI PT to $230 from $180 - OW 

Analyst comments: "Walmart brings a positive catalyst for PI’s food segment. Avery Dennison (AVY, not covered) reported its Q3 earnings this morning. We monitor AVY as one of the key intelligent label suppliers and channel partners for Impinj. On the earnings call, AVY management highlighted details of its recently announced partnership with Walmart, where AVY will utilize its RFID technology to label food products including meat, bakery, and deli items.

We view this as an extremely positive development for overall RFID intelligent label adoption and expect PI to be a key beneficiary. Walmart has already had two successful phases with PI, so we are confident that PI will likely be involved in this next stage of implementation. The initial ramp is expected to start in 4Q2025 and continue for the next two years into 2027. Overall, we expect the AVY and Walmart partnership to significantly boost RFID adoption across the food industry, and we remain very bullish into next week’s PI print."

Google $GOOGL signed its first deal to buy power from a U.S. natural gas plant equipped with carbon capture, aimed at supplying its Midwest data centers. 

The 400-megawatt facility in Decatur, Illinois, will be developed by Low Carbon Infrastructure and is expected to trap about 90% of its CO₂ emissions for underground storage.

The project, built at an Archer Daniels Midland site, marks a new step in Google’s push for 24/7 clean energy as AI data center demand surges. 

ADM will also be able to purchase power from the plant once it comes online in the early 2030s.

Scott Sudder, Southern California Edison
10/23/2025

I wake up every morning thinking about one thing: keeping everyone safe. That's it. That's what drives me.

I work for an electric utility provider on our public safety team. My father worked for the electrical utility too—maybe it's in my blood. I spent 20 years in the Marines working on aircraft electronics, and there are certainly similarities when it comes to safety. What I do now is different, but the mission is still the same: get the work done and keep people safe. It’s a great responsibility, and the stakes couldn't be higher. 

Our communities are surrounded by high-risk fire areas and the changing climate has made everything drier. This means more fuel, more risk and high consequences in the areas we serve. Every single day, 24/7, 365 days a year, we monitor weather conditions so that the electric grid will not be the cause of a wildfire. That's our calling, from the executives on down. And here's the thing: we live in these same communities, ringed in by those same high-risk fire areas too. We're not just protecting customers—we're protecting our neighbors, our families, and ourselves.

Today, thanks to AI and automation, we've transformed a lot of this work. We evaluate and analyze 15 to 20 advanced weather models, including enhanced machine learning models, that help us detect risk in areas that were historically difficult for us to evaluate before. That's a paradigm shift. We can ingest information faster and make decisions with better data on a much larger scale. What used to take our team 8 to 10 hours of manual work (figuring out which customers to notify, what to tell them, analyzing changes in weather forecasts) now takes just under an hour. This isn't just efficiency; it's the difference between customers getting advance warnings or entering a risky period without any notification.

Here's what people should understand about our journey: AI didn't replace our incident management team. Absolutely not—that’s as dangerous as it is impossible. American workers have something AI never will; an innate ability to understand consequences in ways that go far beyond data.

Instead, AI made us better at protecting lives, reducing risk, and keeping our customers and partners informed. We're risk-averse, and we must be. Having better information at our fingertips to make decisions keeps us informed of the risks that are out there. When the consequences are this great, enhanced capability means everything. It's a heavy responsibility, but we must do it, and I'm proud that American ingenuity and technology are helping us do it better.

“The one thing money can’t buy,” said Luckey, “is people who liked you before you had money. I’m very lucky that I met my wife back when I had literally nothing. When we met, I had less than $300 in my bank account … I probably should have gotten married, should have married her when I was 16. Looking back, I think that’s probably my radical belief.”

Crusoe, the AI infrastructure provider building OpenAI’s first major U.S. data center, raised $1.4 billion in new funding, tripling its valuation to over $10 billion in just a year, according to the Financial Times. 

The round was led by Mubadala Capital and Valor Equity Partners, bringing total capital raised to about $3.9 billion.

Crusoe is constructing a 1.2GW AI campus in Abilene, Texas, for OpenAI, a project expected to cost around $12 billion and finish by mid-2026, and another 1.8GW site in Wyoming. The company’s full development pipeline now totals 45GW of capacity, roughly equivalent to the power needs of eight to ten New York Cities.

CEO Chase Lochmiller said the demand for compute infrastructure is unlike anything he’s seen, as AI spending by tech giants is projected to exceed $500 billion annually by 2026.

OH. MY. GOODNESS.

Oracle just completed a $38B DEBT deal to finance more data centers, as per Bloomberg. 

$23.5B towards a Texas center and $14.75B for a Wisconsin one.

Dude…almost $40B of debt…for even MORE data centers?!

The demand for this product is unlike anything we have ever seen — super bullish for all the core names in the space as demand will continue to permeate through the smaller companies that have facilities to supply compute.

JPMorgan Upgrades $COIN to Overweight from Neutral, Raises PT to $404.00 from $342.00

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading Coinbase to Overweight as we look ahead to emerging monetization opportunities and abating risks at what we see as an attractive valuation versus cryptocurrency peers. In particular, we call out two opportunities we see Coinbase as exploring, which could be meaningful to Coinbase equity value.

We see Coinbase exploring a Base token, which we believe could accelerate the growth of development on the Base blockchain while enabling Coinbase to equitize the success in what is the largest Layer 2 on multiple metrics. We also see Coinbase further exploring its USDC payouts. We currently estimate Coinbase pays in excess of $1.00 per share (excluding the higher payout for Coinbase One accounts, which we expect will persist), indicating that client segmentation could be substantially additive to EPS should Coinbase choose to move in this direction.

We are launching our 2027 estimates and establishing a December 2026 price target of $404."

Global PC shipments rose 8.1% in Q3, marking the strongest growth in years as the end of Windows 10 support triggered a broad replacement cycle. 

With about 40% of computers worldwide still running the older OS before the October deadline, both consumers and companies rushed to upgrade their systems.

Lenovo led the market with 17% YoY growth, driven by commercial demand, while HP followed with a 10% increase. 

Apple also saw strong momentum with shipments up 15% on the back of new MacBook models and growing enterprise use. 

Counterpoint Analyst say this upgrade wave is setting the stage for the next phase of growth, centered on AI-capable PCs expected to take off from 2026 onward.

Stifel Downgrades $SNAP to Sell from Hold, Lowers PT to $6.50 from $8.00

Analyst comments: "We are downgrading Snap to a Sell rating as our checks suggest that advertising revenue growth will continue to slow — equating to ceding market share — as Snapchat is not an 'always-on' platform for budgets, and advertisers are increasingly drawn away from Snapchat for incremental test budgets.

Our downgrade is predicated on three key points: (1) our checks have become more negative over time despite a relatively healthy advertising backdrop over the last 18+ months, primarily driven by a lack of unique audience with spendable income; (2) the platform’s most easily monetized surfaces remain underutilized, and social messaging has historically been difficult to monetize; and (3) Snap’s ad tools and solutions have failed to keep up with peers, creating a further hurdle to advertising budget allocation.

We reflect continued market share loss in our forward advertising revenue estimates, and our price target moves to $6.50."

Intel’s $INTC CFO said the company is “blazing a new trail” with 18A. He admitted yields are good enough to meet supply needs but still short of where they need to be for healthy margins. 

He expects them to hit industry-acceptable levels by the end of next year and fully stabilize the year after. 

He added, “on Intel 14A, we’re off to a great start,” saying yields and performance are already ahead of where 18A was at the same stage.

Goldman Sachs Reiterates Sell Rating on $AAL, PT $10

Analyst comments: "American reported a 3Q25 beat, introduced a better-than-expected 4Q25 revenue outlook, and as a result raised its FY 2025 EPS guidance to $0.65 to $0.95 from $0.30 at the midpoint prior. AAL shares closed up approximately 5.5%, outperforming our coverage ex-AAL, which was down around 2.5%.

We believe the primary driver of today’s positive stock reaction is the better-than-expected 4Q EPS outlook of $0.60 at the midpoint, well ahead of FactSet consensus and Goldman Sachs estimates of $0.30 and $0.33, respectively, heading into the print. We believe this was further bolstered by positioning into the print, based on our recent investor conversations.

The above-consensus 4Q EPS outlook is primarily driven by better-than-expected unit revenue (RASM) guidance of flat year-over-year, ahead of consensus at -1.4% and investor expectations. Similar to network peers, American called out that transatlantic should see a significant sequential improvement into 4Q, with the Pacific network also expected to see a material improvement.

Better-than-expected 4Q revenue trends, in conjunction with the 3Q beat, drive our improved FY 2025 EPS estimate of $0.80 versus $0.35 prior. While we are encouraged by the improved earnings outlook into year-end, there is no change to our FY 2026 and FY 2027 EPS estimates of $1.85 and $2.30, respectively, as our improved revenue outlook is offset by higher unit cost inflation.

Our $10 price target (unchanged) represents 22% downside to current levels; reiterate Sell."

Canaccord Genuity Raises $ATAI PT to $14.00 from $11.00 - Buy "significantly undervalued"

Analyst comments: "ATAI, which is on track to merge with Beckley (private) in 4Q25, recently announced that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) to Beckley’s BPL-003 (intranasal mebufotenin), which had solid Phase 2 data for treatment-resistant depression. The company also raised approximately $139 million in net proceeds from an offering, which it said would extend its cash runway into 2029.
Importantly, this runway is catalyst-rich as it includes: (1) an expected top-line readout on the first proposed Phase 3 trial for BPL-003 in treatment-resistant depression; (2) completion of a Phase 2 trial for VLS-01 (DMT buccal film for treatment-resistant depression); and (3) completion of a Phase 2a trial for EMP-01 (oral R-MDMA) for social anxiety disorder. With BTD now in hand, ATAI-Beckley expects to discuss Phase 3 design with the FDA and initiate the pivotal Phase 3 program in 2Q26.

While the stock has been very strong year-to-date (+341%; XBI: +21.7%; SPX: +14.5%), we continue to see room for upside on BPL-003 retreatment data, potential alignment with the FDA on Phase 3 design, and other upcoming data. We also await the closing of the ATAI-Beckley merger, which we continue to view as a solid strategic move, and the planned re-domicile from the Netherlands to the U.S., which has implications for potential index inclusion.

For investors with a longer-term mindset, we continue to view ATAI, which has a multi-asset psychedelic therapeutic pipeline, as significantly undervalued relative to the size of the unmet need and market opportunity in the mental health-focused indications it is targeting. Reiterate Buy."

Stifel Reiterates Buy Rating on $MSFT, PT $650; Earnings Preview

Analyst comments: "While Microsoft posted a near 'perfect print' last quarter (Azure +400bps, EPS +700bps), the stock quickly shed its momentum and has trailed the IGV by approximately 5 percentage points since. We believe the keys to getting the stock back on track include another strong Azure print, sustained operating margin momentum, and insights into the OpenAI relationship.

Based on investor conversations, buyside expectations call for at least a ~300bps Azure beat (40%+ year-over-year in constant currency) and a FY2Q26 constant-currency guide of ~37–38% (assuming 100–200bps of conservatism). We believe these targets seem reasonable given recent Azure beats (300bps and 400bps, respectively, in the last two quarters) and current enterprise spending trends. Anything less would be disappointing.

On the profitability front, the 150–200bps of year-over-year FY26 gross-margin compression caused by the Azure mix shift is well understood by investors, and we remain confident in management’s ability to leverage its increasingly capex-centric business, limit operating expense growth to low single digits, and drive mid-teens EPS growth in coming quarters and years."

Analyst: Brad Reback

The Pentagon said it received an anonymous $130 million donation to pay U.S. troops during the government shutdown, but legal experts say the move may violate federal law. 

Spokesman Sean Parnell said the money was accepted under the Defense Department’s gift authority and earmarked for service members’ pay and benefits. Federal law, however, bars private donors from directing money for specific government uses without congressional approval.

The donation reportedly came from a “friend” of President Trump, who has been seeking ways to fund military pay amid the shutdown. Legal experts note the Pentagon can only accept private gifts in limited cases, such as for military schools or aid to wounded service members and their families.

Even if allowed, $130 million would cover less than one day of payroll for the U.S. military’s 1.3 million active-duty members.

New studies show AI chatbots agree with users about 50% more often than humans. 

This “people-pleasing” habit could mess with how we make decisions or even how research gets done, since the bots tend to tell users what they want to hear instead of pushing back.

OpenAI is reportedly developing an AI music generator 

The company has been working with Juilliard students to annotate music scores and is exploring tools that let users create music from text or audio prompts, like adding instruments to vocals. 

OpenAI may need licensing deals with major labels to avoid lawsuits similar to those filed against rivals Suno and Udio.

We might need to send the Supreme Court to SCUBA training, because that isn't how any of this works.  

The death penalty can be reasonably debated (personally I think killing people who light other people on fire over $200 is fine), but this is nitrogen fanfiction, not science.

A new report from The Information says OpenAI is pushing monetization. Inside the company, some staff are saying it has become another $META, with a growth over everything mindset.

The company is adding engagement features like ChatGPT suggesting follow up tasks so users stay chatting longer. At the same time, they are improving daily tools like checking stocks, sports scores and weather. 

But they are also adding a feature that will tell users to take a break if they have been using the chatbot for too long, which feels like a strange contradiction.

Even the research group is feeling the shift. Post training work is now being measured on engagement metrics instead of just making the model better. Some employees say that is the clearest sign that OpenAI is turning into the kind of engagement machine it once criticized.

One employee says: We do not want to become engagement farmers.

OpenAI is trying to balance two identities. But that balance is getting harder to hold

That balance is getting harder to hold.

More than 40% of Philip Morris International's revenue now comes from its smoke\-free products \(Zyn, IQOS, etc\.\)

Is any company in the tobacco industry better positioned for growth than Philip Morris?

DID YOU KNOW MICROSOFT INVESTED IN MARK ZUCKERBERG'S FACEBOOK

On this week in 2007 Microsoft agreed to invest $240 Million into Facebook for a 1.6% stake valuing the company at $15 Billion

Here's an article from that day on why Microsoft overpaid😅

Today Meta Platforms (Formerly Facebook) is now worth $1.854 TRILLION meaning a 1.6% stake is currently worth

$29.7 BILLION

Microsoft sold some of its Facebook shares for a big profit after the company's IPO in 2012, though it kept a partial stake.

When I understood I only get to live once, I spent countless hours to understand high quality businesses even more than insiders. 

Then I build a concentrated portfolio.

Life is too short to diversify away from early retirement. 

I own these businesses because I see value in them long term. 

Retirement does not mean full exit, it just meant I be spending way less time on the market to enjoy life. 
I be rolling covered calls, Cash secure puts and chill. 

I hope many find their retirement path that they feel comfortable!

Alright, that is it.

California (more specifically, the state legislature and Gavin Newsom) just banned Glocks, the most common firearms in the country by far, for being "unsafe", claiming they are too easy to convert into machine guns.

The government claims Glock could have updated their designs to make these illegal conversions harder, that their refusal to do so puts blood on their hands.

In reality, California law is the reason those updates were never made!  California (more specifically, Kamala Harris) decided in 2001 that all new handgun designs needed to include microstamping, a non-existent but patented technology that engraves every round with two unique serial numbers as they are fired.  Existing designs were grandfathered in, but any changes whatsoever, even texture or color changes, would require this new non-existent technology.  It is worth noting that she did so by specifically warranting that the technology was commercially available, which triggered a provision in an existing piece of legislation despite not being true.

As a result, California has been stuck with Glocks designed in 1998.  There have been several generations of updates in every other state that make them safer in a variety of ways.  It is crazy to blame Glock for not updating their designs in California when the law prohibits them from doing so.

$NVDA CEO Jensen Huang:

“AI doesn’t care where it goes to school.”

“The world has an abundance of energy, it’s just in the wrong place.”

“We can build power generation in those areas, put data centers there, train AI models… and when they graduate, bring them back to where they are used.”

“In the future, you’ll see data centers built far from population and the power grid. No reason to build batteries. Just use the energy, train AI, and bring the trained model back.”

WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE A DEAL FOLKS. 

The Chinese Embassy posted that after successful trade talks during the weekend, the US & China have agreed to:

- make full use of the China/US economic and trade consultation mechanism 

- maintain close communication on respective concerns in the economic and trade fields
 
- promote the healthy, stable and sustainable development of economic and trade relations to benefit the two peoples and contribute to global prosperity

Bessent: "The President had given me maximum leverage when he threatened 100% tariffs if the Chinese imposed their rare earth global export controls, so I think we have averted that."

SoftBank has approved the remaining $22.5B to complete its planned $30B investment in OpenAI, per The Information.

The funding is contingent on OpenAI finishing its corporate restructuring that would allow a future IPO. 

If restructuring fails, SoftBank’s total investment would scale back to $20B.

The money would help fill out OpenAI’s $41B financing round announced in April.

Calling 0 or near 0 revenue companies the next trillion market cap daily/weekly wont make it happen.

2021 investors learnt the hard lesson from SPAC, and yes most of them had revenue and were growing.

Hope is not a good way to find high-quality businesses!

so you're telling me...

we are about to cut rates into a market that's at all time highs AND is putting up double-digit earnings growth?

this could be a really solid run towards end of year, here's some of the dynamics for why:

- we just had a 3% drawdown on the S&P which resulted in some 30% drawdowns for individual names, regardless of what you think of those names, it likely was needed to get some of the froth out of the system to allow the next leg higher

- the reason for that 3% drawdown was because of China-US tensions, we aren't out of the woods but if we are closer to being out of the woods...markets will be very happy

- more geopolitical peace around the world is a tailwind, potential russia/ukraine ceasefire could be next

- earnings have been INCREDIBLE so far, whether it's banks or semiconductors or clothing...almost every company is beating on the top and bottom with EPS beats way ahead of the street...potentially showing AI is a tailwind for margins

- AI capex not slowing down

- if we see the big tech companies produce some monster numbers this week...it will only reinforce why AI is so important and why the multiple on the broader market is expanding

- 7.4T still on the sidelines

- gov reopening will be good

- $NVDA may be able to sell to China soon if the deal allows it which would be a massive tailwind for all semis and AI capex

plenty of things to be concerned about (like labor market) but overall macro tailwinds with fed easing and AI does seem to support a strong bull case

Sam Altman is launching Merge Labs to challenge Musk's Neuralink with a brain interface that does not require surgery. 

He has recruited Caltech scientist Mikhail Shapiro, who works on using ultrasound and gene therapy to read neural signals. 

Altman says he wants to “think something and have ChatGPT respond,” without implanting a chip in his brain.

RBC Capital Upgrades $HON to Outperform from Sector Perform, Raises PT to $253 from $235

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading Honeywell from Sector Perform to Outperform following a solid 3Q25 that, in our view, marks the start of the breakup catalyst-rich phase heading into the planned 2H26 separation of Aerospace and Automation. We see growing momentum across core segments, improved visibility on execution, and a credible roadmap toward value unlock. Our sum-of-the-parts valuation implies attractive upside. With management executing well, separation milestones approaching, and ‘deal purgatory’ perceptions fading, we believe investor focus will shift to the structural upside embedded in two strong standalone franchises positioned for sustainable growth and margin expansion."

Analyst: Deane Dray

$BMNR $ETH

Bitmine now owns 3.31M ETH after buying 71K coins last week, now owning 2.8% of the entire supply. 

Tom Lee:

“The progress in trade talks between US and China is a positive for Ethereum and crypto broadly. These are global assets and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging in crypto a few weeks ago. While the fundamentals of Ethereum and crypto are 'uncorrelated' to equities, Fundstrat work has shown that in the past 15 years, Ethereum and crypto perform better when equities rise, meaning crypto is correlated to 'risk-on' assets via the associated leverage channel. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year (ETHwas $2,500). Given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We increased our cash holdings to $305 million (from $219 million) and acquired 77,055 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.31 million, or 2.8% of the supply of ETH.”

TD Cowen Reiterates Buy Rating on $AAPL, PT $275

Analyst comments: "iPhone and seasonality to drive favorable sentiment into year-end. We expect Apple to report September quarter revenue in line with or above the Street’s +7.5% year-over-year estimate and to guide December quarter revenue up high-single-digits, with iPhone units up low-single-digits year-over-year. iPhone 17 demand driven by replacements could evolve into an even stronger artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade cycle in calendar year 2026 and beyond.

We model Services revenue up +13% year-over-year as Google search advertising revenue remains intact. Apple stock sentiment is markedly positive given the encouraging consumer reception for the iPhone 17 and the sustained search ad revenue stream from Google. While current iOS AI features support demand, we believe higher-performance hardware features in the second half of 2026 will further accelerate iPhone growth. We expect December quarter guidance to reflect solid seasonality with revenue up high-single-digits year-over-year."

$HOOD

ROBINHOOD UPGRADE FROM $105 TO $161 BY COMPASS POINT:

- Our 3Q EBITDA forecast is 6% above the Street and we expect HOOD to disclose October trends pacing well above 4Q expectations. 

- 4Q offers additional upside QoQ alongside higher prediction market volumes, crypto fee pricing and staking revenue. 

- While HOOD trades at a premium 62x our 2026E EPS (43x EBITDA), we're comfortable with our Buy rating as long as revenue/EBITDA continue exceeding expectations.

Street seems to be increasing EPS expectations going into 2026 which isn’t that wild if operating margins continue to grow…

$HOOD +5%

iRobot $IRBT tumbled 35% after the Roomba maker warned its search for a buyer has stalled. 

Its last bidder walked away and offered a price “significantly lower” than recent trading levels. 

Since Amazon pulled its $1.7B deal in 2024, iRobot has struggled with cash and debt, saying there is still “substantial doubt” about staying in business.

Rosenblatt: 'There is room for $QCOM to generate significant AI inference related revenue longer-term'

Analyst comments: "We view today's announcement as positive for the Qualcomm shares for the longer-term. For years management's strategy has been to diversify its end markets while growing its smartphone market share." 

"Landing a 200MW deployment with HUMAIN is a very good step in a new growth vector in AI inference data centers. As a reminder, in May this year AMD and HUMAIN announced a 500MW deployment worth $10B." 

"While revenue details have not been provided, we expect Qualcomm's deployment with HUMAIN may generate ~$2B. Deployment is expected to start in 2026. Inference stage AI market is expected to be $250B+ by 2030 and growing ~20% annually. There is room for Qualcomm to generate significant AI inference related revenue longer-term."

📢 𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐈𝐍: OpenAI Urges U.S. to Boost Energy Capacity to Maintain AI Lead

OpenAI called on the White House to expand U.S. energy capacity, warning that electricity is a strategic asset for AI infrastructure. 

The startup urged building 100 GW of new capacity annually, citing China’s 429 GW expansion versus the U.S.’s 51 GW. OpenAI’s planned data centers require massive power, highlighting an “electron gap” that could jeopardize U.S. AI leadership. “Electrons are the new oil,” the company said.

$QQQ $SPY | Nomura: Tension-Escalation-Truce Cycle Becomes New Normal for U.S.-China Relations

Nomura's Chief China Economist, Lu Ting, highlights that U.S.-China relations are entering a recurring cycle of tension, escalation, and temporary truce. 

Recent trade talks in Kuala Lumpur indicate eased tensions, with potential concessions such as extended tariff truces and resumed Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans. 

However, unresolved issues like rare earth exports, trade agreement compliance, and geopolitical disputes may trigger renewed conflicts. Lu predicts that while both sides remain interdependent in the short term, competition between the two superpowers will inevitably escalate, making this cyclical pattern the new normal.

It is fascinating to watch people sold great companies before the hot run up, then became the biggest bear.

Timing the market never worked over the long term.

UBS Upgrades $UPWK to Buy from Neutral, PT of $21

Analyst comments: "With improved web traffic data in recent months and a continuing shift toward higher-value services, Upwork appears positioned to return to positive gross services volume (GSV) growth over the next two quarters (versus the Street’s Q1 inflection). We believe this inflection—after five quarters of declines—could be a positive catalyst for shares, adding conviction around our above-consensus 2026 estimated EBITDA (+3% versus Street). Additionally, we believe Upwork’s improved free cash flow (~9% yield) is underappreciated, as buybacks are reducing share count for the first time in company history, bolstering the firm’s high-teens return on invested capital profile."

Analyst: Joshua Chan

MICROSOFT $MSFT AND OPENAI JUST UPDATEd THEIR RELATIONSHIP

"The agreement preserves key elements that have fueled this successful partnership—meaning OpenAI remains Microsoft’s frontier model partner and Microsoft continues to have exclusive IP rights and Azure API exclusivity until Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)."

Here is what is changing:

- Once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel.

- Microsoft’s IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032 and now includes models post-AGI, with appropriate safety guardrails.

- Microsoft’s IP rights to research, defined as the confidential methods used in the development of models and systems, will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first. Research IP includes, for example, models intended for internal deployment or research only. Beyond that, research IP does not include model architecture, model weights, inference code, finetuning code, and any IP related to data center hardware and software; and Microsoft retains these non-Research IP rights.

- Microsoft’s IP rights now exclude OpenAI’s consumer hardware.

- OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties. API products developed with third parties will be exclusive to Azure. Non-API products may be served on any cloud provider.

- Microsoft can now independently pursue AGI alone or in partnership with third parties.

- If Microsoft uses OpenAI’s IP to develop AGI, prior to AGI being declared, the models will be subject to compute thresholds; those thresholds are significantly larger than the size of systems used to train leading models today.

- The revenue share agreement remains until the expert panel verifies AGI, though payments will be made over a longer period of time.

- OpenAI has contracted to purchase an incremental $250B of Azure services, and Microsoft will no longer have a right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider.

- OpenAI can now provide API access to US government national security customers, regardless of the cloud provider.

- OpenAI is now able to release open weight models that meet requisite capability criteria.

TRUMP:

- JENSEN SHOWED ME THE BLACKWELL CHIP IN THE OVAL OFFICE

- I’LL SPEAK WITH XI ABOUT BLACKWELL

Jensen today told everyone that Nvidia has a $500B opportunity over the next *five* quarters (street was expecting $380B) and that was…without China.

absolutely incredible to witness 🤯

אם אנבידיה תכניס ב5 רבעונים הבאים 500b כמו שאמרה ( ללא סין ) רווחים של 250b לשנת 2026 הגיוניים בהחלט עם שולי הרווח הנקי של החברה.
זה עם שווי השוק הנוכחי המכפיל p/e יהיה 20.
אנבידיה זולה לדעתי
ואנחנו רק בתחילת המהפכה הטכנולוגית הגדולה בהיסטוריה
לא ייעוץ פיננסי.

KeyBanc Upgrades $SWKS to Overweight from Sector Weight, Sets PT at $105

Analyst comments: "We upgrade Skyworks Solutions following the merger announcement with Qorvo. Our upgrade is based on: (1) The merger being highly complementary, combining Skyworks’ strong execution track record with Qorvo’s best-in-class RF technologies and superior BAW filter capabilities; (2) Consolidation of a maturing subsector, which should result in improved pricing and margin expansion; and (3) Over $500 million in cost synergies, leading us to forecast $7.46 in EPS for calendar year 2027. While the deal carries risk given the expected 18-month closing timeline and required China approval, we see a favorable risk/reward profile with SWKS trading at 11x our 2027 EPS estimate. Additionally, we are raising estimates for both Qorvo and Skyworks to reflect the positive September quarter preannouncement."

UBS Upgrades $VSCO to Buy from Neutral, Raises PT to $46 from $25

"We upgrade Victoria’s Secret for three reasons: 

(1) We have increased conviction in management’s ability to reposition the Victoria’s Secret and PINK brands, which should lead to sustained comparable sales growth following several years of declines, driving market sentiment higher; 

(2) Our estimates imply meaningful upside of 9% and 22% to Street FY25 and FY26 forecasts, as we believe consensus is not fully reflecting VSCO’s operating leverage potential; and 

(3) We see a powerful EPS growth algorithm, with the combination of +3.5% sales growth, fixed cost leverage, and free cash flow deployment toward debt repayment and buybacks expected to drive a 21% four-year EPS CAGR through FY29E. We anticipate EPS beats over the next twelve months to catalyze the stock toward our $46 price target."

Aston Martin is feeling the pressure from US tariffs and soft China demand. 

Q3 revenue dropped 27% and losses widened, so they’re cutting costs and rethinking future models. 

Capital investment is getting trimmed from £2B to about £1.7B over five years, and they no longer expect positive free cash flow in the back half of the year.

Mercedes stuck with its full-year outlook and confirmed it will move ahead with a €2B share buyback over the next 12 months after Q3 margins came in within guidance. 

Adjusted return on car sales was 4.8% and liquidity rose to €32.3B. 

EV and hybrid sales improved, but China remains a major drag with sales down 27% in the quarter and US tariffs adding pressure. 

Management says the environment is still challenging as it cuts costs to protect profitability.

Barclays 3 Key Takeaways from  $ADBE (Buy, PT $465) Max user Conf:

(1) Adobe’s AI strategy centers on aggregating third-party models so customers can use Adobe as a 'one-stop-shop' for creative design. The company is seeing clear growth in seats and content creation despite concerns about potential headwinds from generative AI; 

(2) Adobe will transition to a Total ARR reporting and guidance framework—its second financial disclosure change in two years—which may face skepticism, but we believe continued double-digit growth in customer groupings remains the key value driver; and 

(3) the conversational experiences announced at the keynote suggest that while third-party inferencing could raise costs, it should reduce operating expenses related to training."

DA Davidson on $NVDA (Buy, PT $250):

We believe that the market is currently discounting upside to data center revenue through FY26.

We continue to believe the market may be underestimating the insatiable demand for compute. Management stated that they expect the Blackwell/Rubin generations in 2025/26 to generate $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold, with 6M GPUs already shipped, with consensus estimating data center revenue through that time period at approximately $366B; guidance that's now ~37% above where consensus is. 

That being said, we do not believe that the market is appropriately pricing in the upside to these numbers. To that end, we see no reason to change our perspective on the capabilities of models today and future models, while we see the current levels of demand for compute from labs like OpenAI as justified and do not believe we're reaching levels warranting the characterization of 'overbuilding'.

BofA on Bloom Energy $BE: 'Strong headline beat, but optimism likely priced in'

Bloom Energy posted a solid 3Q topline and margin beat (revenue $519M, +57% YoY; GM 30.4%), driven by AI-linked data-center deployments and early Brookfield JV projects. While MW growth and FY25 guidance upside validate commercial traction, we see this largely priced in amid consensus expectations for accelerating AI power demand. The quarter does little to resolve uncertainty around true project economics, cash conversion, and sustainability of Brookfield-driven volumes. We look to update our numbers following our management callback and will incorporate insights from our upcoming expert panel with former Bloom and Microsoft executives on SOFC deployment.

Interesting chart from Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on $NVDA's AI server roadmap: 

Power requirements are climbing fast as Blackwell, Rubin, and later Feynman roll out. 

NVIDIA is also shifting to 800V DC architectures with “Kyber” racks by 2026, expanding its reference design from GPUs to full data-center power infrastructure. 

'Over the next 1–2 years, NVIDIA will likely balance efficiency gains against ramp feasibility; longer term, the architecture is expected to converge on single-stage conversion.'

BofA Raises $AAPL PT to $320 from $270 - Buy; Street High

Analyst comments: "Apple’s ecosystem, brand strength, and large installed base remain key competitive advantages. We present a long-term (next five years) framework for Apple’s performance, projecting both product and services revenues while considering potential new offerings the company may introduce in that period. 

We evaluate the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Apple’s business—enhancing opportunities in new products such as AI-augmented eyewear and in-house AI robots/smart home devices, while potentially disrupting traditional search-related revenues. We reiterate our Buy rating on strong capital returns, Apple’s positioning as an eventual winner in AI at the edge, and the optionality from new products and markets. Our FY25E revenue and EPS move to $418 billion and $7.41, respectively. Our price objective increases to $320 (from $270), based on 32x our CY27E EPS of $9.88 (previously 32x CY26E EPS of $8.40), as our five-year analysis strengthens confidence in our estimates."

The upward revision in our price objective reflects a lower cost of equity capital, stronger progress in Robotaxi development, and an increased valuation for Optimus to capture potential international market expansion."

Apple $AAPL is preparing to bring OLED displays to more of its mainstream devices, per Bloomberg. MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Air models with OLED panels are being tested, with the iPad mini likely first, possibly next year. 

OLED improves contrast and color, but adds cost, so pricing may rise by around $100 on the mini.

Apple has also tested a new water-resistant casing and vibration-based speaker design for the mini. 

The next iPad Air refresh will still use LCD, but Apple plans to move the model to OLED after that. The entry-level iPad currently has no OLED transition planned.

BofA Securities Raises $NVDA PT to $275 from $235 - Buy 

Analyst comments: "We hosted a highly positive meeting with NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress and members of the investor relations team following the CEO’s keynote at the GTC trade show in Washington, D.C. The discussions reinforced our confidence in NVIDIA’s: (1) Solid visibility for calendar years 2025 and 2026, supported by over $0.5 trillion in orders at a conservative $25 billion per gigawatt versus potential for $30 billion+; (2) Strong alignment across the supply chain, including multiple memory suppliers; (3) Zero China expectations, with any trade resolution being incremental; (4) Continued leadership over ASIC and GPU competitors, who lack NVIDIA’s deployment experience (NVIDIA already in its second-generation GB300 racks); and (5) A robust multi-year pipeline—Rubin on track for 2H26E—driving expansion into new markets such as Nokia 6G, Uber self-driving cars, industrial twins, and robotics.

We view valuation at 32x/25x CY26E/27E P/E as compelling, given it represents less than 1x the earnings growth rate (PEG ratio) versus broader 'Mag-7' and growth peers trading above 2x. We raise our price objective to $275 from $235 on a higher 44x CY26E P/E multiple (up from 37x), which equates to 35x on the ~$8 EPS power outlined by NVIDIA, consistent with historical valuation levels."

$GOOGL Public Sector continues to rack up wins in state and local government 

ODU just launched “MonarchSphere,” an AI incubator built with Google Cloud. They’re using Vertex AI and Gemini models to speed up research and streamline campus operations. One example: genomic AI training workloads that used to take ~24–40 days on-prem now finish in 2–3 days. ODU is also rolling out AI tools for advising, curriculum development, and career support — and joining Google’s AI for Education Accelerator to expand workforce training.

At the same time, Los Angeles has deployed Google Workspace with Gemini AI to all 27,500 city employees as part of its SmartLA 2028 digital modernization. They’re using it for multilingual communication, document summarization, and data analysis across 45 agencies — with full AI ethics training completed for the workforce.

Maryland has also enabled Gemini AI in Google Workspace for 43,000 state employees across 59 agencies, with 12,500 already active users. Teams are applying it to website development, chatbot creation, and sentiment analysis under the state’s Responsible AI policy.

$UBER plans to start offering driverless rides in San Francisco next year using Lucid $LCID Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro’s self-driving tech. 

Testing is underway now. This puts Uber in direct competition with $GOOGL's Waymo in its home market, while Uber targets 100,000 autonomous vehicles on its platform starting in 2027.

$FUBO and Disney $DIS have officially closed the Hulu + Live TV merger, creating a business with close to 6 million subscribers in North America. 

That makes it the sixth largest pay TV provider in the United States. Disney now owns about 70 percent of the combined company, while Fubo shareholders retain about 30 percent.

Both services will continue to operate separately. Hulu + Live TV will stay inside the Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN Unlimited bundle, and Fubo will continue with its own app focused on sports viewers.

Fubo CEO David Gandler will lead the combined operations. Fubo’s advertising sales group will now be handled by Disney’s advertising team. The companies expect savings on content costs and better advertising revenue. Disney has also committed to a 145 million dollar term loan in 2026.

Nvidia $NVDA is supporting a new Digital Realty data center in Virginia, called Aurora, focused on reducing power strain. 

The facility will use Emerald AI software that shifts computing workloads in real time based on grid conditions. 

A prior test showed the technology could lower power consumption by about 25 percent for several hours during periods of high grid stress while maintaining service.

The project is part of a new flexible power certification developed with Nvidia, Emerald AI, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the PJM regional grid operator. 

The approach is meant to help data centers better manage electricity use as the industry expands and as more renewable energy comes online.

📢 𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐈𝐍: $ORCL 'Oracle Default Swaps Jump on Concerns Over AI Spending Spree' - Bloomberg

Credit traders are increasingly buying protection against Oracle Corp. defaulting on its debt, a trend Morgan Stanley expects to continue as the company invests billions in artificial intelligence. 

The cost to insure Oracle’s debt over the next five years is near its highest level since October 2023, according to ICE Data Services. Morgan Stanley projects Oracle’s net adjusted debt will more than double to roughly $290 billion by fiscal year 2028 from around $100 billion and recommends investors buy the company’s five-year CDS and bonds. 

Analysts Lindsay Tyler and David Hamburger noted that “near-term credit deterioration and uncertainty may drive further bondholder and lender hedging.”

🇺🇸 Pending home sales were flat in September, missing expectations of a 1.2% monthly gain after August was revised up to +4.2%. 

Still, sales rose 1.5% year over year, the strongest since late 2024, as lower mortgage rates improve affordability. 

NAR says softer labor conditions may be limiting demand, though the “lock-in effect” is easing and helping inventory. 

Regionally, contract signings increased in the South and Northeast and declined in the West and Midwest.

$F, Value investors are not safe at all. 
Do pay attention to debt chart and growth.

Many got lucky with $UNH, but the debt path is still unsustainable. These large businesses need to address the debt problem first, if they care about shareholders.

Just be careful, a legacy business may not go away completely, but it won't have good ROI for shareholders. 
If your investing thesis is hoping Warren Buffett to buy the dip on cheap legacy businesses when they missed earning for quarters, you may want to stick to SP500. 

Not Financial Advice!

The Fed said it will stop shrinking its balance sheet on Dec 1. Starting then, it will roll over all maturing Treasuries and reinvest all agency and MBS payments into Treasury bills, ending current runoff caps. 

This marks the full halt of quantitative tightening.

Wouldn’t say interest rates are accommodative right now “but they’re meaningfully less tight than they were, and that should help so that at least the labor market doesn’t get worse.”

It is a complicated situation.

FACEBOOK $META JUST REPORTED EARNINGS

EPS of $1.05 missing expectations of $6.66🔴
Revenue of $51.2B beating expectations of $49.4B🟢

Meta said it had a $15.9 Billion one time expense:

"We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, the implementation also led to the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. As a result, the third quarter 2025 provision for income taxes includes a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion."

FACEBOOK $META JUST REPORTED EARNINGS

EPS of $1.05 missing expectations of $6.66🔴
Revenue of $51.2B beating expectations of $49.4B🟢

Meta said it had a $15.9 Billion one time expense which without that their EPS woulf have been $7.25 which would have been a beat

"We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, the implementation also led to the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. As a result, the third quarter 2025 provision for income taxes includes a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion."

$GOOGL CEO on Search & Agentic AI & Ads Testing:

“We see agentic experiences as additive to the way people seek information. It helps us answer people’s tough questions, helps them get things done, and helps businesses in the process… We’re working on multiple agentic experiences across key verticals like travel, commerce, and shopping.”

“AI Overviews drive meaningful query growth, and this effect was even stronger in Q3… particularly among younger users.”

“AI Mode is resonating well with users… queries doubled over the quarter, now at 75M daily active users in the U.S.… we’re testing ads, but it’s too early to share details.”

“AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search as people learn what they can do with our new AI experiences… they’re increasingly coming back to Search more.”

“Look, I think… it’s a dynamic moment. …between AI and AI Mode, we are able to give that range of experience for people in this moment.”

“AI Overviews drive meaningful query growth, and this effect was even stronger in Q3… more pronounced with younger people.”

“AI Mode is resonating well with users… strong and consistent week-over-week growth… queries doubled over the quarter… over 75M daily active users. Most importantly, AI Mode is already driving incremental total query growth for Search.”

“Over time, you can expect us to make the experience… simpler — just like we did at Universal Search many years ago… you will see evolutions like that.”

We will be bringing more agentic AI capabilities to Chrome soon... and will release Gemini 3.0 later this year, also testing ads.

Trump called his meeting with Xi “amazing” and rated it “12 out of 10,” and said broader trade is coming soon. 

Key Takeaways:

• Fentanyl-related tariffs cut to 10% effective immediately. Broader U.S. tariffs on China reduced to 47% from 57%

• China will “start immediately” buying U.S. soybeans and China will remove “roadblocks” on rare-earth exports for at least a year.

• Chips discussions will continue; $NVDA can talk directly with China. Trump said they were “not talking about Blackwell.”

• The U.S. will postpone its probe into Chinese shipbuilding,

• Taiwan did not come up.

• Trump will visit China in April; Xi was invited to visit the U.S. afterward.

• Joint cooperation pledged on Ukraine, trade, and AI

• XI: China is willing to work with U.S.

Volkswagen swung to a €1.3B operating loss in Q3, hit by a €5.1B charge tied to Porsche’s EV delays and U.S. tariffs. Revenue still rose 2% to €80.3B, and VW reaffirmed full-year guidance with sales seen roughly flat versus last year. The outlook hinges on chip supply, as the Nexperia dispute risks disrupting production.

KeyBanc Downgrades $MTRN to Sector Weight from Overweight, Removes PT (prior $117)

Analyst comments: "Following MTRN's 3Q25 results and our recent analysis, our 2025–2026 EPS estimates are relatively unchanged, but we are downgrading shares to Sector Weight from Overweight (previous price target of $117). Business wins in several growth markets are encouraging; however, uncertainty around PMI's 2026 clad demand and lingering procurement risks from Chinese customers present a balanced risk-reward. Since our upgrade on July 17, MTRN shares have risen 31% compared to the S&P 500's 9% gain."

B. Riley Upgrades $VIAV to Buy from Neutral, Raises PT to $18 from $12

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading Viavi Solutions from Neutral to Buy as the company benefits from a significant tailwind driven by the ongoing secular growth cycle in artificial intelligence and data centers (AI/DC), which will likely be further supported by the timely acquisition of Spirent’s high-speed testing business. We expect accelerating revenue growth to drive multiple expansion.

On Wednesday (10/29 AMC), Viavi reported fiscal 1Q revenue and EPS of $299 million and $0.15, beating consensus estimates of $294 million and $0.13. Revenue increased 25.6% year-over-year, aided in part by Inertial Labs. Strength came primarily from fiber optics solutions for AI/DC and aerospace/defense markets. The optical industry continues to see robust demand as hyperscalers aggressively expand AI infrastructure — a trend that benefits Viavi, a major supplier of optical testing solutions.

We view Viavi as a stronger investment relative to transceiver companies such as Coherent (COHR — Neutral, $85 PT), as the industry’s shift toward co-packaged optics (CPO) could pressure transceiver companies by reducing their dollar content."

TRUMP ON CHINA:

I had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China. There is enormous respect between our two Countries, and that will only be enhanced with what just took place. We agreed on many things, with others, even of high importance, being very close to resolved. 

I was extremely honored by the fact that President Xi authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products. 

Additionally, China has agreed to continue the flow of Rare Earth, Critical Minerals, Magnets, etc., openly and freely. 

Very significantly, China has strongly stated that they will work diligently with us to stop the flow of Fentanyl into our Country. They will help us end the Fentanyl Crisis. 

China also agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy. In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska. 

Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out. 

The agreements reached today will deliver Prosperity and Security to millions of Americans. After this Historic trip to Asia, I am now heading back to Washington, D.C. 

I want to thank the Great Countries of Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for being so generous, gracious, and hospitable — Also, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, who were at the Dinner last night hosted by His Excellency Lee Jae Myung. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are being brought into our Country because of them. Our Nation is Strong, Respected, and Admired Again and, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

BofA on $META, Lowers PT to $810 from $900 - Buy

Analyst comments: "We expect Meta stock to be controversial given a limited EPS growth outlook and year-over-year free cash flow pressure in 2026. However, we see Meta in a position of strength with a massive user network and the opportunity to integrate compelling AI products (including content creation tools) over the next two years. We believe the bad news on expenses is now mostly 'in' the stock, while product catalysts, including a new large language model (LLM) and content creation tools, can drive upside engagement and revenue in 2026. Also, while free cash flow will likely decline in 2026, at the $695 after-hours price Meta is valued at 10.5x 2027E EBITDA and 19x 2027 core business EPS, which we think can help support the stock."

Samsung Electronics posted strong Q3'25 results, with revenue up 9% year-over-year to ₩86.1 trillion ($60.3B) and operating profit rising to ₩12.2 trillion, above expectations. The semiconductor division led the rebound, with sales up 13% to ₩33.1 trillion and operating profit at ₩7 trillion, driven by record-high memory revenue of ₩26.7 trillion.

Samsung said demand for high-end memory like HBM3E and DDR5 continues to surge, with 2026 orders already outpacing supply. The company plans a significant capex increase next year to expand DRAM and HBM4 production, citing accelerating AI infrastructure demand. Foundry operations began mass production of its first 2nm process and secured record-high customer orders for advanced nodes.

Oppenheimer Downgrades $META to Perform from Outperform

"Significant investment in Superintelligence despite unknown revenue opportunity mirrors 2021/2022 Metaverse spending. Implied 4Q opex/capex both 7% ahead of Street and guiding FY26 capex dollar growth 'notably larger than 2025' and expenses 'significantly faster' than 2025's +23%, both ahead of Street." 

"While 3Q ex-FX advertising +25% vs. 2Q's +21% and 4% above Opco/Street, no rationale for guidance of 600bps deceleration in 4Q. Moreover, we believe investors will struggle to rationalize the PE until there is visibility into 2027, as aggressive revenue growth offset by high spending. This compares to GOOG with predictable earnings at a reasonable PE. Meanwhile, both companies trading at same PE (21x 2027E) and Search could outgrow META at some point in 2026."

Wells Fargo on $META: 

"Clearly this was the worst of the bunch. The language on 2026 operating expenses and capital expenditures again took another step function higher qualitatively. While META did not explicitly give us anything, clearly they are signaling much higher starting points for next year versus what everyone was thinking. The setup was that we were not expecting anything to materially alter the buy-side model calculation on the 3Q call from a cost standpoint. That did not happen.

On top of that, 4Q revenue is $1 billion below the whisper. Bulls are defending it, blaming assumptions on foreign exchange not being as big in terms of the assumed headwind. That is fair, but (1) EPS is calculated off reported revenue and (2) optically, while we can debate how big of a deal this is at face value, when you do the beat math and calculate the new exit rate to help inform your view of 2026 revenue, it is coming down.

So the net of that is buy-side revenue lower next year, operating expenses and capital expenditures higher, so that $34–35 people had penciled in now looks more like $32. On top of that, from a narrative standpoint, there is a re-emerging view that META is spending on Capex and AI like it is a frontier model builder but has nothing to show for it in terms of return. It is not making money renting out the GPUs like GOOG or MSFT, and it does not seem to have a real new monetizable product in the near term. So estimates get whacked and now the narrative too. Less conversation on 2027, but early chatter is 2027 EPS now more mid-$30s."

Goldman Sachs on $CMG, Lowers PT to $45 from $52 - Buy

Analyst comments: "We acknowledge near-term inflationary headwinds (now expecting mid-single-digit inflation in 4Q25/2026E) and industry-wide macro pressures expected to weigh on traffic amid challenges faced by Chipotle's core consumers in younger and lower income cohorts (<$100k). Management noted reservations around pricing, with no immediate plans to take incremental price in 4Q (despite rolling off 2% in December) and an intention to price below inflation to keep the brand's value proposition strong for pressured consumers.

We model same-store sales growth (SSSG) of -3.6% for 4Q25E, translating to -1.9% for FY2025E, followed by a more subdued recovery of 1.5% in 2026E (vs. 3.3% assumed prior). We continue to like CMG's long-term growth story and remain encouraged by the company’s commitment to culinary innovation (3–4 protein LTOs per year vs. 2 historically) and its increased focus on operations, digital, and marketing under the 'Recipe for Growth' strategy. With some macro improvement, we see opportunity for transaction-driven comp growth long term."

Goldman Sachs Raises $GOOGL PT to $330 from $288; Recap:

1) Search & Other demonstrated strong growth (including management disclosing that both paid clicks and CPCs grew +7% YoY) demonstrating broad-based strength across verticals; 

2) the YouTube complex (Ads + Subscriptions) showing continued momentum with YouTube Ads growth of +15% YoY and management highlighting the growing contribution from subscription offerings; 

3) Google Cloud was the highlight of the results (in our view) with +34% YoY revenue growth, +79% YoY revenue backlog growth, 23% segment operating margins and a host of positive commentary from management on the earnings call; 

4) continued balance of operating efficiencies to fund growth investments while still producing a normalized upward margin trajectory; and 

5) long-term upside optionality inside the Alphabet structure with Waymo and quantum computing. A change of 2025 capex guidance from ~$85bn to a range of $91–93bn results in an adjustment in our forward forecast, while management was not ready to guide to 2026 capex at this point, we have adjusted our 2026 capex estimate to ~$122bn (+32% YoY)."

"What’s most bullish to me is their commentary about AI experiences driving people to come back to search more, and CPC and paid clicks continue to accel – this basically should blow the whole bear case about ChatGPT displacing search completely out of the water (are you taking notes BIDU?). Meanwhile, stronger capex for 2026E, 'tremendous' demand for TPUs, Gemini at 650mn MAUs, tokens processed up another +33% vs 3 months ago to 1.2 quadrillion 20x y-y – all these read incredibly bullish for AI infra names, and especially the likes of $AVGO, $CLS, $LITE, Quanta, Inventec, GCE, TTMI, Global Brands."

Stifel Maintains Buy Rating on $PUMP, Raises PT to $20 from $7

Analyst comments: "We are reiterating our Buy and SHARPLY increasing our PT on PUMP to $20 from $7 based on our new sum-of-the-parts analysis detailed below. Our new target price reflects its substantial expansion plans for its Power business, including: 1) expectations to have 220 MW contracted by year-end 2025; 2) receiving delivery of 360 MW of power assets on order by early 2027; 3) ordering additional capacity to have 750 MW delivered by year-end 2028; and 4) the financial flexibility of a $350 million lease financing facility. Importantly, energy is a key bottleneck in the scaling of high-performance compute infrastructure, and hyperscalers appear willing to pay a premium for low-latency and highly reliable power infrastructure. Access to power is trumping the cost of power, and this is likely to persist, fueling demand for power assets like PUMP has on order."

Needham Reiterates Buy Rating on $CVNA, PT $500

Analyst comments: "We continue to see Carvana as the best large cap growth story in our coverage with a visible, lengthy growth runway against conservative near term unit guidance vs recent results, with CVNA's consistent execution and long term guidance showing the power of the model and increasing separation from peers reporting more volatile results. We believe CVNA deserves multiple expansion as a long term compounder, similar to other clear-cut leaders in large TAMs such as streaming or food delivery. Our $500 price target is 35x our '27E adj EBITDA, or 25x our '30E adj EBITDA discounted back, and underwritten by CVNA achieving their 3M retail unit goal at 13% margins in 2033."

$CMCSA trading lower after management warned of near-term EBITDA pressure. 

Comcast said broadband margins will “decline over the next several quarters” as it invests in pricing, product, and customer experience. 

CFO also flagged upfront dilution from new NBA rights, saying the amortization of those costs will hit profit “particularly in the first season.”

Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Rating on $TMDX, Raises PT to $147 from $142

Analyst comments: "TMDX delivered revenue in line with CGe, but slightly short of consensus, which we think will drive the stock down (and present an interesting buying opportunity) despite the solid overall quarter and guidance increase. TMDX delivered $143.8M in revenue vs. $144.1M CGe/$144.6M consensus. The quarter was essentially what we expected, as the overall Q3 transplant market’s seasonality (that management repeatedly communicated) impacted TMDX.

Given the expectation for a seasonally slow and relatively in-line quarter, we believe our thesis is intact and believe any dip in the stock price creates a buying opportunity for longer-term investors, especially considering the pipeline of growth drivers. We note that these drivers are not baked fully into our future expectations and include the Heart and Lung clinical trials integrating new devices and/or solutions in the US, implementation of NOP and logistics OUS, and US OCS Kidney – all of which will occur over the next few years. We are keeping our forward estimates relatively unchanged and are reiterating our BUY rating. We are raising our PT to $147 from $142 as the comp group multiple increased."

Trump has extended the National Guard deployment in Washington, D.C. into 2026.

More than 2,300 troops from multiple states will remain stationed under Title 32 orders, which allow limited law enforcement authority. The mission was originally set to end in November but will now continue indefinitely, focusing on “beautification” projects around the National Mall and other tourist areas.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the extension earlier this week. D.C. officials have criticized the move, and the city’s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit to end the deployment.

$RBLX is falling after Q3 showed losses widening and costs jumping. Net loss $257.4M vs $240.4M y/y, with cost of revenue up 45% and infrastructure and safety expenses up 61% to handle record usage. 

Management also flagged near-term margin pressure and “slight” margin declines in 2026, with elevated capex starting in Q4 and potential headwinds next year from tough comps and new safety policies that could create short-term friction to engagement and bookings. 

They also did not give 2026 guidance, and advertising is not a near-term growth lever.

$META $NVDA

The Meta 12% sell off feels weird for this one reason: 

How is the street giving Nvidia a $5T valuation on the backs of increased capex but at the same time punishing Meta for increasing capex?

I don’t really get it. There are only a handful of companies that can buy $NVDA GPUs at the scale that the Mag 7 can. Meta is one of those companies.

Jensen’s “$500B in 5 quarters” statement two days ago is largely fueled by companies like Meta that need to continue spending. $GOOGL and $MSFT also increased their capex guidance. 

So if the argument is $META is down because of being aggressive on capex for 2026, why is Nvidia holding $5T? They both should be symbiotic with each other: one providing the other’s revenue today while the other providing the other’s future AI ROI tomorrow. 

The tax charge is a nothing burger. Companies have to pay their taxes. Revenue growth was 26%…every other core metric is up including ad impressions (14%) and price per ad (10%). 

So the street is upset that they are going to spend more? 

Now, the $25B bond raise this morning I think is the actual issue as investors are concerned that the company is continuing to fuel its capex financing via debt…which signals to me investors are more scared about no AI ROI. That’s a fair concern…just not something that can be the biggest concern if the company supplying the chips for all that ROI is hitting ATHs but the customer buying it is getting punished for it.

I bought a little at $659…2026 estimates looking like $META is now in the low 20s…will do more DD but not fully sold on actually establishing a position like I am on $AMZN (have been adding there aggressively over the past month) but a bit confused why the street is that upset about capex.

Silver is a better investment than Gold Long-Term🧵

Silver is so much more important and versatile metal than gold. Hence it is manipulated to the max, while everyone is praising Gold. More than half of silver supply or heading to 70% are going to industrial applications when Gold is 12% or less. Gold pathetic main case is jewelry. 

Silver:

Electronics: Silver is used in electrical contacts, switches, circuit boards, and conductors in nearly every electronic device, from smartphones and computers to household appliances.

Solar energy: In the photovoltaic industry, silver paste is applied to silicon wafers in solar panels to capture and transport electricity from sunlight.

Automotive: As vehicle electrification accelerates, the demand for silver in electric cars is growing. It is used in electrical connections, switch contacts, and engine bearings.

Medical: Silver is widely used in medical equipment, including coatings for breathing tubes and catheters, because of its antimicrobial properties that help fight infections.

Brazing and soldering: Silver-based alloys are used to join metal parts in applications from plumbing and refrigeration to aerospace and automotive engineering.

Not Financial Advice!

General Atlantic, a global growth equity firm, is leading a $2B private credit deal to refinance Shutterfly’s debt, according to Bloomberg. 

The Apollo-owned company has about $2.5B in gross debt, with 84% maturing between 2026 and 2027. 

The financing would help retire existing bonds and loans as Shutterfly’s credit metrics improve following an S&P upgrade to B- and a positive Moody’s outlook.

Palantir $PLTR has filed a lawsuit against two former employees, Radha Jain and Joanna Cohen, accusing them of stealing confidential data to build a rival AI company called Percepta, backed by General Catalyst.

The company claims the pair violated non-compete and confidentiality agreements, taking access to Palantir’s “crown jewels” such as its source code and customer workflows to create what it called a “copycat” platform.

Palantir is seeking to block Jain and Cohen from using its data and to force the return of stolen materials.

$MSTR | Michael Saylor’s Strategy Returns to Profitability on Bitcoin Gains

Strategy Inc., co-founded by Michael Saylor, returned to profitability in Q3, reporting net income of $2.8 billion, or $8.42 per share, compared with a loss of $340 million a year ago. 

Gains were driven by the rising value of its ~$69 billion Bitcoin holdings. Legacy software revenue rose 11% to $128.7 million, above analyst estimates. 

The company is exploring credit securities internationally, though demand for preferred stock remains tepid, slowing recent Bitcoin purchases. 

Strategy’s guidance assumes a year-end 2025 Bitcoin price of $150,000.

$AMZN CEO:

AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022. Reaccelerating to 20.2% YoY. Our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that YoY% growth is a relative term. It's very different. Having 20% YoY growth on a $132B ARR, & to have a higher % growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors. 

Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals. In October, which together are more than our total deal volume for all of Q3.

“Another 1+ GW coming in Q4, and expect to double total capacity by 2027. Power remains the main industry bottleneck.

Our custom Trainium 2 chips are fully subscribed... With 30–40% better price performance than competitors, demand remains strong across large and mid-sized customers. Trainium 3 will preview later this year, with full volumes expected in early 2026.

$AMZN CEO ON RECENT LAYOFFS ANNOUNCEMNT:

The recent 14,000 job cuts were driven by culture, not financial and not even really AI driven, not not right now at least.

When you grow as fast as we did, you add layers and complexity that can slow you down. Sometimes that weakens ownership among the people actually doing the work and making day-to-day decisions.

Amazon $AMZN CEO Andy Jassy just said when asked about Amazon's recent corporate layoffs:

"The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven. And it's not even really AI driven, not right now at least.

It really. It's culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers. 

And when that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work. And who own most of the two way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line. And it can lead to slowing you down. And as a leadership team, 

we are committed to operating like the world's largest startup. And that means removing layers and means increasing the amount of ownership that people have. And it means inventing and moving quickly. 

I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general with the technology transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean. It's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast. And that's what we're going to do."

$NVDA CEO Jensen Huang said Samsung manufactures all of Nvidia’s robot processors, as the two companies announced a partnership to build an AI Megafactory that will deploy over 50,000 Nvidia GPUs to integrate artificial intelligence across Samsung’s chip design, production, and quality control.

The facility will use Nvidia Omniverse to create digital twins of chips and fabrication plants for virtual testing, showing a 20x improvement in computational lithography performance. Samsung will also use Nvidia’s Blackwell and Jetson Thor platforms to develop factory robotics and extend digital twin technology to its smartphone and appliance factories.

The companies are also collaborating on HBM4 memory chips, expected to reach 11 gigabits per second when production begins next year.

Jefferies on $RDDT (Buy, PT $300): 'Scary Good Growth'

"Another commanding beat/raise underscores RDDT’s attractive opportunity to deepen/broaden advertiser spending through performance enhancements, new products, and easing usability. Importantly, Revenue/EBITDA upside coincided w/ further expansion in users, supporting the bull case that RDDT's attractive monetization opportunity will be magnified by l-t growth in impressions. We stay Buy as RDDT’s peer-high growth does not appear reflected in valuation."

Here’s what analysts have to say after $AMZN earnings:

Evercore ISI (Outperform; PT $335) – Mark Mahaney
"We reiterate Outperform/Top Pick; raise PT to $335. THIS was the AWS Unlock Quarter—20% Y/Y growth, backlog $200B, Trainium2 +150% q/q, flipping AI narrative positive. Retail remains robust (double-digit growth, OM up Y/Y), Perishable Checkout to 2,300 stores, Rufus adds $10B sales. Ads +22% Y/Y; NBA on Prime boosting viewership. AWS, Retail, and Ads momentum support higher valuation."

Morgan Stanley (Overweight; PT $315) – Brian Nowak
"AWS accelerated and faster growth lies ahead: 1) Capacity growth, doubling GW capacity by ’27; 2) Surging backlog—October new business > entire Q3; 3) Innovation via Trainium3. Retail delivered strong top-line and EBIT. ’26/’27 EPS +5%/6%. PT to $315. AMZN remains Top Pick—revisions trump narrative in AI-driven market."

Oppenheimer (Outperform; PT $290) – Jason Helfstein
"Increasing target to $290 (from $245) as AWS 3Q revenue growth accelerated to +20% y/y vs. +17% in 2Q and is “gaining momentum.” Added 3.8 GW in the past 12 months, on track to double by 2027 (4x 2022 levels), with >1 GW coming online in 4Q. We model 4Q AWS revenues +22%, though that seems conservative assuming ~$3.2B per new GW. Project Rainier data center 23% online (7 of 30 buildings) to reach 2.2 GW. Total EBIT 9%/7% above Opco/Street estimates ex-one-time items. AWS commentary was more bullish than 2Q, with most of the call focused on cloud, AI, and chips. No notable change in consumer spending (prices flat to down) but some expectation for tariff inflation. Ad revenues +22% ex-FX, consistent with 2Q. Our PT assumes 10x FY26 AWS revenue and 6x E-commerce GP or 29x EBIT."

BofA Securities (Buy; PT $303) – Justin Post
"Results suggest ramping AWS capacity can drive growth… Trainium demand strong… capacity outlook supports AWS optimism; re:Invent will showcase Trainium, Nova, and new partners. eCommerce share gains continue. Rolling SOTP to 2027E (from 2026E) and raising PT to $303 on 33x ’27 GAAP EPS. Reiterate Buy."

Canaccord Genuity (Buy; PT $300) – Maria Ripps
"Amazon reported solid Q3… revenue +1% vs. consensus; OI above expectations. AWS growth accelerated ~270 bps q/q to >20%, fastest in 11 quarters. Backlog $200B; +3.8 GW capacity added; doubling power by 2027. Trainium2 +150% q/q; Trainium3 40% more cost-efficient coming YE. Ads growth +60 bps q/q, driven by Prime Video & DSP. AWS inflection point—investors gaining comfort in Trainium’s positioning. Shares should gain momentum into 2026."

Truist Securities (Buy; PT $290) – Youssef Squali
"AWS cleared the key bar of 20% growth ahead of schedule… Trainium2 adoption progressing nicely with nearly 500k chips online and 1M expected by year-end, resulting in a multi-billion business growing 150% q/q. We remain at Buy while looking for widening Bedrock/Trainium3 adoption to validate the bull case premised on tens of billions of dollars of AI Cloud ARR."

Raymond James (Outperform; PT $275) – Josh Beck
"AWS cleared 20% growth ahead of schedule… Trainium2 adoption strong with 500k chips online, expected to reach 1M by year-end… multi-billion business growing 150% q/q… We remain Outperform while watching for further Bedrock/Trainium3 adoption to validate multi-billion-dollar AI Cloud ARR potential."

Telsey Advisory Group (Outperform; PT $300) – Joe Feldman
"Amazon should continue to gain market share leveraging Prime, small business relationships, and technological edge. Growth in grocery, private brands, pharmacy, logistics, and generative AI add to value. AWS and advertising should continue to outperform and support Retail. Raising PT to $300, applying a ~16x EV/EBITDA multiple to higher 2026 EBITDA of ~$198B."

Citizens JMP (Market Outperform; PT $300) – Andrew Boone
"Amazon beat expectations… AWS revenue +20% Y/Y on $130B+ run-rate, showing AI spend benefit… Trainium3 available 1H25; power capacity to d…

Here’s what analysts have to say after $AAPL earnings:

Goldman Sachs (Buy; PT $320) – Michael Ng
"AAPL’s F4Q25 EPS beat as a beat in Services more than offset a miss in iPhone; iPhone demand was strong, with the miss driven by supply constraints. F1Q26E revenue growth guidance of 10–12% Y/Y includes DD% iPhone growth and ~14% Services growth. We believe this underpins a multi-year upgrade cycle supported by (1) AI software improvements (advanced Siri, new AI partnerships), (2) form factor innovation (foldable iPhone in 2026), and (3) continued ecosystem investment. Services revenue growth of 15% Y/Y and strong margins (47.2% despite $1.1B tariff costs) highlight Apple’s premium mix and ecosystem strength. AAPL guides record F1Q26 gross margins (47–48%) despite tariff costs. Opex growth reflects rising AI R&D, which we view positively for long-term innovation."

Evercore ISI (Outperform; PT $300) – Amit Daryanani
"AAPL reported in-line Sept-qtr results but standout was SIZABLE UPSIDE to Dec-qtr guide: sales +10–12% (vs. +6% Street) driven by low-teens Services and DD% iPhone growth. Sept-qtr revenues $102.5B (+7.9% Y/Y) and GM 47.2% (above high end of guide). For Dec-qtr, GM expected 47–48% (+30bps q/q). Implied Dec-qtr rev/EPS ~$138B/$2.65 vs. Street $132B/$2.54. Some EPS upside offset by higher OPEX for Siri/AI ramp (launch Spring 2026). Raising PT to $300."

Baird (Outperform; PT $300) – William Power
"AAPL reported solid FQ4 results and guided FQ1 revenue growth 10–12%, above prior forecasts. Improved upgrade rates and normal seasonality supported guidance. While stronger revenue outlook is offset by higher AI investments—pressuring near-term EPS—we believe these are the right long-term moves. Improving growth profile and future AI opportunities justify a premium to the S&P 500."

Melius (Buy; PT $345) – Ben Reitzes
(PT raised to $345 from $290 while maintaining Buy. No full commentary provided.)

Citi (Buy; PT $315) – Atif Malik
(PT raised to $315 from $245 while maintaining Buy. Commentary not provided but aligns with bullish trend on AI and iPhone cycle.)

TD Cowen (Buy; PT $325) – Krish Sankar
"Sep ’25 revs grew 8% Y/Y despite supply constraints, and Dec Q guide of 10–12% beat Street forecasts on strong iPhone 16 & 17 demand. Tariff impact in line; GM expansion +100bps Y/Y impressive. Services mid-DD% growth trend positive. Higher AI R&D necessary for competitiveness, though FY26 growth view limits any negative leverage."

Oppenheimer (Outperform; PT $290) – Jason Helfstein
(No AAPL note in this batch; including for format alignment: AWS/AAPL commentary only applied to AMZN earlier.)

Rosenblatt (Neutral; PT $250) – Barton Crockett
"Apple’s F4Q25 report in-line; F1Q26E revenue guide a big beat, offset by higher costs. FY26E sales up, EBITDA/EPS slightly down. Using more generous multiple, PT up $9 to $250 (31x FY26E EPS). EPS CAGR only 10% (FY25–FY27E). We assume Apple can retain PEG premium in a high-growth iPhone 17 cycle. Maintain Neutral."

Jefferies (Hold; PT $246.99) – Edison Lee
"AAPL’s Sep Q rev grew ~8%, 6%/1% above JEFe/cons. iPhone rev +6%, other products (Mac, iPad) beat. GM 47.2% (~0.5% beat incl. $1.1B tariff). Guides 10–12% rev growth in Dec Q (+6% vs. cons). JEFe slightly up; $100 iPhone 18 price hike offsets volume growth, product mix negative for margin. Strong 1QFY26 and hope for Fold limit downside. Upgrade to HOLD."

Reuters (Market Context)
"Apple shares rose ~2% premarket after upbeat holiday-quarter forecast suggested iPhone 17 models driving rebound despite China supply delays. Market cap crossed $4T, joining Nvidia and Microsoft. Investors see slower AI rollout as deliberate. Stock trades at 33.4x FY26E EPS—premium to Microsoft (31.7x) and Meta (22.3x)."

Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid was the only voting Fed member who voted for the FOMC to NOT cut rates this week

Fed President Schmid just relased a full statement as to his reasoning ... here is the full thing

Title - Dissent Statement by Jeff Schmid

"At this week’s FOMC meeting I dissented against lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. My preference would have been to leave the target range unchanged.

By my assessment, the labor market is largely in balance, the economy shows continued momentum, and inflation remains too high. I view the stance of policy as only modestly restrictive. In this context, I judged it appropriate to maintain the policy rate at this week’s meeting.

Talking to contacts in the Kansas City Fed’s district, I hear widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation. Rising healthcare costs and insurance premiums are top of mind. In the data, inflation is spreading across categories, both goods and services.[1] Inflation has been running above the Fed’s 2 percent objective for more than four years. As I have said before, I take small comfort in most measures of inflation expectations having not moved up. I view inflation expectations not as an input into Fed’s decisions, but as the outcome of the policy decisions that the Fed makes.

As it is, I see the stance of policy as being only modestly restrictive. Financial market conditions appear to be easy across many metrics. Equity markets are near record highs, corporate bond spreads are very narrow, and high-yield bond issuance is high. None of this suggests that financial conditions are particularly tight or that the stance of policy is restrictive. Likewise, the economy is showing continued momentum. Consumption remains solid, and data for July and August suggest an acceleration through the summer.

Fixed capital investment, an interest sensitive component of growth, has shown some of the strongest increases. The contribution of software spending to GDP growth was the largest on record in the second quarter. And the contribution of investment in information technology to GDP growth in the first quarter was the highest on record with the exception of the first quarter of 2000.

With inflation still too high, monetary policy should lean against demand growth to allow the space for supply to expand and relieve price pressures in the economy.[2] With the dual mandate, Congress has directed the Federal Reserve to manage the trade-offs that arise from the economy-wide constraint that ties inflation to unemployment. Constraints lead to difficult decisions over how to balance competing objectives.

In certain circumstances the Fed’s actions might have disproportionate effects on the two sides of the mandate. Now, for example, I do not think a 25-basis point reduction in the policy rate will do much to address stresses in the labor market that more likely than not arise from structural changes in technology and demographics. However, a cut could have longer-lasting effects on inflation if the Fed’s commitment to its 2 percent inflation objective comes into question. In the end, inflation is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility and within its control, and as I balance the mandate—and the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in meeting that mandate—my preference was to hold the policy rate steady at this week’s meeting."

Jonathan Webb, The Nuclear Company

America built over 100 nuclear reactors between 1960 and 1990. We’ve built just two since then.

Nuclear construction didn't just slow. It nearly died. The nation that first split the atom and put men on the moon somehow forgot how to pour concrete and weld steel at scale. Projects that should have taken five years stretched to fifteen. Budgets exploded from billions to tens of billions. The belief that we could build anything, anywhere, at any speed, the faith that defined American industry, evaporated.

We built The Nuclear Company to reverse this decline. We’re building an AI-powered deployment platform with technology-enabled systems that will allow our frontline teams to deliver America’s next hundred reactors. The result will be low-cost, resilient, plentiful energy. And we’re doing it by empowering the people who build them.

Consider what passes for normal in nuclear construction today. At the Vogtle plant in Georgia, the two reactors built over the last 30 years, more than 10,000 people worked at peak plant construction. Those workers often sat idle. Waiting on parts and materials. Waiting on engineering changes. Waiting on documentation. Just waiting. When documents did arrive (sometimes by wagons or wheelbarrows), the volumes of paperwork lacked specifics. Metal joints misaligned went undetected for weeks, forcing costly and lengthy rework. Workers knew problems were mounting. They could feel it, but they lacked the tools to see patterns fast enough to intervene. One told me: "We knew things were going wrong. We just couldn't see it fast enough to stop it." Our frontline workers are brilliant, but the tools they’ve had can't keep pace.

We’re building AI-enabled software that allows workers to command the build, not just survive it. We’re building it for the foreman on site at 4am, not just executives in boardrooms. AI agents trained on tens of thousands of pages of project documents identify problems in hours instead of months. Drones scan construction sites and catch misalignments within a millimeter, alerting workers through earpieces: "Please check that weld." That's giving American workers capabilities they've never had before.

This isn't automation replacing workers. It's augmentation elevating them. Kids with high school diplomas, people with two-year degrees. AI will help bring out their irreplaceable talents. 

We run our company from Middle America. Not New York City or San Francisco. As we build these facilities, we’ll create some of the highest-paying construction jobs in the country and generate tax revenue for communities that need it most. Not for a few years, but for a century.

What we need is to make sure that our teammates can do their jobs. That's why we're giving them the tools they deserve, so building America's energy future doesn't break the people building it.

omg they are taking $META down

officially below $650 for the first time since May 

what are we thinking folks…

street’s not liking the capex spend

wonder if we all look back at this a year from now and think that a 15% dip on a Mag 7 was one of the best buys going into 2026

or maybe this one has entered a phase of consolidation that will be very painful 

just hard for me to believe increased capex is why they deserve to be punished…almost like the street saying they don’t believe $META can get any ROI from their spend

ELON MUSK ON X PHONE: 

I am not working on a phone. I can tell you where I think things will go, which is that we’re not going to have a phone in the traditional sense.

There won’t be operating systems. There won’t be apps in the future... you’ll have … AI on the server side communicating to an AI on your your device … generating real-time video of anything that you could possibly want

It’s probably five or six years or something like that.

Brad Gerstner: “A big question I keep hearing is how can OpenAI do $13B in revenue but have $1.4T in spending commitments?” 

Sam Altman: “We are doing more revenue than that & if you want to sell your shares, let me know. It’d be cool to be public so I could tell the loudest voices to just short the stock.”

The 🇺🇸 White House just released this fact sheet titled

"President Donald J. Trump Strikes Deal on Economic and Trade Relations with China 🇨🇳"

Here's what the White House says is going to hapen

CHIN**ESE 🇨🇳 A**CTIO**NS:

- Ch**ina will suspend the global implementation of the expansive new export controls on rare earths and related measures that it announced on October 9, 2025.
- China will issue general licenses valid for exports of rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite for the benefit of U.S. end users and their suppliers around the world. The general license means the de facto removal of controls China imposed in April 2025 and October 2022.
- China will take significant measures to end the flow of fentanyl to the United States. Specifically, China will stop the shipment of certain designated chemicals to North America and strictly control exports of certain other chemicals to all destinations in the world.
- China will suspend all of the retaliatory tariffs that it has announced since March 4, 2025.  This includes tariffs on a vast swath of U.S. agricultural products: chicken, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.
- China will suspend or remove all of the retaliatory non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since March 4, 2025, including China’s listing of certain American companies on its end user and unreliable entity lists.
- China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025 and also purchase at least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028.  Additionally, China will resume purchases of U.S. sorghum and hardwood logs.
- China will take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia’s facilities in China, allowing production of critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world.
- China will remove measures it took in retaliation for the U.S.’s announcement of a Section 301 investigation on China’s Targeting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance, and remove sanctions imposed on various shipping entities.
- China will further extend the expiration of its market-based tariff exclusion process for imports from the United States and exclusions will remain valid until December 31, 2026.
- China will terminate its various investigations targeting U.S. companies in the semiconductor supply chain, including its antitrust, anti-monopoly, and anti-dumping  investigations.

AMERIC**AN 🇺🇸 ACT**IONS**:

- The **United States will lower the tariffs on Chinese imports imposed to curb fentanyl flows by removing 10 percentage points of the cumulative rate, effective November 10, 2025, and will maintain its suspension of heightened reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports until November 10, 2026.  (The current 10% reciprocal tariff will remain in effect during this suspension period.)
- The United States will further extend the expiration of certain Section 301 tariff exclusions, currently due to expire on November 29, 2025, until November 10, 2026.
- The United States will suspend for one year, starting on November 10, 2025, the implementation of the interim final rule titled Expansion of End-User Controls to Cover Affiliates of Certain Listed Entities.
- The United States will suspend for one year, starting on November 10, 2025, implementation of the responsive actions taken pursuant to the Section 301 investigation on China’s Targeting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance.  In the meantime, the United States will negotiate with China pursuant to Section 301 while continuing its historic cooperation with the Republic of Korea and Japan on revitalizing American shipbuilding.

I have this partially-formed hypothesis that artist backlash against generative AI crystalized largely in response to text-driven user interfaces.

The art world has come to accept tools like Photoshop (and earlier, photography itself) that still share the aesthetics of traditional art creation.  If MidJourney, ChatGPT, DALL·E, etc had interfaces along the lines of Nvidia Canvas from 2020 (pictured below), it would look enough like existing tools that critique would look purist and elitist.

Art via command line, on the other hand, looks sufficiently Other that you can easily berate the users as Not Artists.  "You just typed a few words, you aren't an artist!" has a better ring than "Your drawing skills rely on Photoshop somewhat more than mine, you aren't an artist!"

President Trump announced a U.S.–China economic and trade deal:

China 🇨🇳 will suspend all retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures since March 4, lift rare earth export controls, issue global licenses for rare earths and critical minerals like gallium and graphite, and commit to buying 12M metric tons of U.S. soybeans this year and 25M tons annually through 2028. It will also take “significant measures” to stop fentanyl shipments to the U.S.

In return, the U.S. 🇺🇸  will lower the tariffs on Chinese imports imposed to curb fentanyl flows by removing 10% points of the cumulative rate, effective Nov 10, 2025, and extend Section 301 tariff exclusions to Nov 2026, and pause new export control measures for a year

OPEC+ agreed to a small 137,000 bpd output hike for December but will pause further increases through March.

Saudi Arabia and Russia led the decision, citing weaker seasonal demand and uncertainty from recent U.S. sanctions on Russian producers.

The next two deepdives are out!

These are on $GRAB and $NBIS.

The $GRAB deepdive is a refined version of a thesis I wrote up a few months ago that many people may have already read.

Nebius $NBIS is a name that has done exceptionally well for retail investors and is up 3x YTD. 

Given the AI revolution, the datacenter space has become integral and it seems like Nebius will play a very important role in this sector. After doing the deepdive, I do believe the company has a moat due to it's full stack, vertically integrated advantage and it is becoming very clear why people are choosing this name as their core datacenter exposure over the many other plays that are out there.

While the stock has already performed and it is understandable if investors feel they missed it (like myself), I tried to see the broader tailwinds for the business and if the $30B company could one day become a $100B company. 

Will be working on the next 2 deepdives for November (please leave any comments for tickers you'd like to see) along with some more deepdives into big tech earnings, the state of the bifurcated economy, where we are in the macro, and more! 

The substack is free (always will be) and has no paywall -- all the previous deepdives on $BMNR and $DUOL are available to see and more content will be posted throughout the week recapping the big tech earnings. 

Deepdives below:

Piper Sandler Upgrades $ROKU to Overweight from Neutral, Raises PT to $135 from $88

Analyst comments: "Roku 3Q results were unremarkable relative to our expectations. But commentary on the call suggests 1) strong underlying fundamentals in Platform across Ads and SSD. We now have more confidence in the Platform revenue glidepath into 2026 and take our revenue growth forecast to ~14.5% (from prior 12%), a starting point we think that could land in the high teens by year-end '26. Additionally, 2) ROKU was GAAP Op Income positive this quarter, well ahead of promised profitability for 2026. Finally, 3) like a 'grown up' company, ROKU began executing on its capital return program this past quarter repurchasing $50MM in stock of an initial $400MM plan."

UBS Upgrades $CSCO to Buy from Neutral, Raises PT to $88 from $74

Analyst comments: "We upgrade Cisco to Buy based on a multi-year growth cycle driven by AI infrastructure demand, a large-scale Campus refresh cycle, and momentum in Security.

Key Drivers:

1. AI Infrastructure Demand Surging: a. Cisco secured over $2B in AI orders in FY25, nearly all from hyperscalers, with two-thirds for full systems running Silicon One and the rest optics/optical. b. Enterprise and Sovereign demand is now ramping, with Enterprise orders approaching $1B, up sharply from a couple hundred million dollars in the most recent quarter, positioning Cisco for sustained AI-fueled growth in FY26 and FY27.

2. Campus Refresh Cycle Accelerating: a. Cisco’s installed base includes tens of billions of dollars in aging Cat 4K/6K gear (5–15 years old). b. Upgrades to AI-enabled Smart Switches are expected to drive Campus growth from 5% in FY26 to approximately 7% in FY27.

3. Security Portfolio Reboot Gaining Traction: a. Next-gen products like Hypershield are growing over 20%, and Splunk integration is gaining traction."

B. Riley Downgrades $RGTI to Neutral from Buy, Raises PT to $42 from $35

Analyst comments: "We like September's $11.5M in deals, which expand the commercial horizon as the path from 100- to 1,000-qubit systems from YE25 to 2030 gets going. Consensus 3Q25 estimates seem makeable, though we do not expect a 4Q25 guide per norms, and caution that delayed US government funding authorizations lend sales risk. Operating cash burn of approximately ($19M) per quarter seems manageable with $572M in cash. After popping 190% YTD to lift the market cap to $14.3B—which discounts 52% of the 2030 to 2035 TAM—and with a significant percentage of long-term commercial success already priced in, we move to the sidelines with RGTI shares but with ongoing technology and commercial engagement attention."

Stifel said Macau’s October gaming numbers were “much stronger than anyone expected,” even after a weak Golden Week. 

The firm noted that “VIP players came back in droves” in the second half of the month, pushing GGR to the best level since 2019. 

They think the market is “clearly inflecting,” see 2026 growth in the 4%–8% range, and added that this rebound should keep investors interested in Macau names heading into next year.

Aletheia Capital Initiates Coverage on $AMKR with Buy Rating, PT $62

Analyst comments: "We initiate coverage of Amkor with a BUY rating and a TP of $62, based on an SOTP (18x implied FY27E PER). Amkor, a leading U.S.-based OSAT provider, is well-positioned to benefit from two major secular tailwinds: the surging demand for CoWoS packaging and the America Manufacturing initiative. We expect Amkor to expand its existing overflow Hopper GPU packaging business with NVDA by capturing first-source CoWoS opportunities, including GB10, Vera and B30, as well as winning Broadcom’s TPU V6 & V7 ASIC slots in 2026. In addition, Amkor could add new slots such as Spectrum-X, CPX, Tomahawk, etc. Amkor is constructing a $7 billion advanced packaging facility in Arizona, scheduled to begin operation in 2028. We believe this site has attracted strategic investment from key customers, reinforcing its long-term growth visibility and U.S. supply chain localization. We forecast Amkor’s CoWoS sales to grow 2.5x in FY26E and a further 50% in FY27E, resulting in EPS growing at a 65% CAGR from FY25E–27E."

Microsoft $MSFT said it has received approval from the United States 🇺🇸 to ship Nvidia $NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪 for the company to use in the country

"Microsoft says it the first company this year under the Trump administration to secure export licenses from the Commerce Department to ship GPUs to the UAE." ... Approved in September "these licenses enable us to ship the equivalent of 60,400 additional A100 chips, in this instance involving Nvidia’s even more advanced GB300 GPUs."

"From the start of 2026 to the end of 2029, we will spend more than $7.9 billion in the UAE. This includes more than $5.5 billion in capital expenses for ongoing and planned expansion of our AI and cloud infrastructure"

Tesla $TSLA is reportedly close to a $2.1 billion, 3-year deal with Samsung SDI to supply energy-storage system (ESS) batteries, according to The Korea Economic Daily.

The batteries would likely be produced at Samsung SDI’s JV plant with Stellantis in Indiana, which is being partially converted for ESS production. Samsung aims to expand U.S. ESS capacity to 30 GWh by end-2026.

The deal, still unconfirmed, would help Tesla diversify away from Chinese suppliers as AI-driven data-center demand fuels a surge in U.S. grid-storage investment.

$PLTR

Palantir earnings today after the bell 🥶

This will be my 18th quarter covering the company and things have changed dramatically from 4 years ago.

Street is expecting $0.17 of EPS and $1.09B of revenue. 

I believe Palantir will beat both of these numbers and grow revenues 50%+ this quarter.

Now, the stock has made a move to ATHs before earnings, so I’m not sure how good the beat will need to be for the street. 

As always, Palantir is a company that I genuinely care more about the actual company fundamentals more than the stock as the company is up 25x from the lows of 2022. I also plan to hold the name for a very long time so seeing consistent growth is the most important for me.

A strong topline beat, guidance raise for 2025, increased operating margins, and overall customer count will be important.

Ultimately, I believe that if the foundation model companies are getting higher valuations, then the company that is:

- actually profitable

- showing business usecases via AI in the enterprise

- and the single most important enterprise stack according to Jensen…

likely deserves to be one of the premier names in AI. 

No other company is growing as fast or with the types of margins that Palantir is growing with.

Excited to cover another quarter for the company that changed my life! 

LFG.

The U.S. housing market has seized up. 

Only 28 out of every 1,000 U.S. homes have changed hands in 2025, the lowest turnover rate in at least 30 years.

The problem isn’t that people stopped wanting to move. It’s that millions are locked into pandemic-era mortgages around 3%, while new loans cost about 6.2%. Trading homes means adding hundreds more to a monthly payment.

Most owners are staying put, and that choice is rippling through the economy. Fewer moves mean weaker construction demand, slower job growth, and less consumer spending. 

The housing market is calcifying.

The U.S. Treasury cut its Q4 borrowing estimate to $569B, down $21B from July’s forecast, mainly due to a higher starting cash balance. It now expects to end December with $850B in cash.

For Q1 2026, Treasury projects $578B in borrowing, also targeting an $850B cash balance.

In Q3, Treasury borrowed $1.06T, about $50B more than projected, driven by higher cash reserves and lower net cash flows. Further details will come with the Quarterly Refunding announcement on Nov. 5.

Sarepta’s $SRPT ESSENCE confirmatory trial for Amondys 45 and Vyondys 53 FAILED to reach statistical significance, though the company said data showed “encouraging trends” favoring treatment over placebo.

Sarepta blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for data disruptions and said excluding impacted participants shows a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in disease progression over two years. The therapies maintained a favorable safety profile, and Sarepta will meet with the FDA to seek full approval based on ESSENCE plus multi-year real-world evidence.

Q3 revenue came in at $370M (down from $467M YoY), with $238.5M from PMO therapies and $131.5M from Elevidys. Sarepta also said it refinanced 2027 notes, achieved positive cash flow, and expects to finalize Elevidys labeling discussions with FDA soon.

Starbucks $SBUX is forming a joint venture with Boyu Capital to operate its China retail business, selling a 60% stake valued at about $4B (cash-free, debt-free) while retaining 40%.

The deal values Starbucks China at over $13B, factoring in the sale, its retained stake, and long-term licensing income. The venture will continue running 8,000 stores in China and aims to expand to 20,000 locations over time.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said the partnership combines Starbucks’ global brand with Boyu’s local expertise to accelerate growth “into smaller cities and new regions.”

When there is no comp to a high quality business, that will often mean massive upside at an inflection point. 

I'm addicted to those no comp high quality businesses!

The problem is far too many are unwilling to study a business enough to own it before the inflection point. It is much easier to buy after it accelerated growth for quarters and years. 

That is not exactly superior return, it is called average return. 

With that said, nothing is wrong with being average. Most will have a nice retirement investing consistently w/ average return or just DCA into SP500

UBS chairman Colm Kelleher warned of a “looming systemic risk” in the U.S. insurance industry, saying it stems from “a lack of effective regulation” and “huge rating agency arbitrage” as insurers pile into private credit.

He compared the trend to the 2007 subprime era, noting a “massive growth in small rating agencies ticking the box for compliance of investment.” U.S. life insurers now hold about a third of their $5.6T in assets in private debt, up from 22% a decade ago.

Kelleher also said Switzerland is “having a bit of an identity crisis” in global banking as Hong Kong and Singapore rise as major wealth hubs.

$TSLA has appointed Sharad Agarwal, former head of Lamborghini India, as its new country head.

Agarwal will oversee on-the-ground operations and build a more localized strategy. Tesla has sold roughly 800 cars in India since its July launch, constrained by high import tariffs that price the entry-level Model Y above 6 million rupees ($67,000)

Norway’s $2.1T sovereign wealth fund said it will vote against $TSLA $1T pay package for CEO Elon Musk, citing concerns over the award’s “total size, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk.”

Norges Bank Investment Management, which owns 1.1% of Tesla, said it still “appreciates the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role” but the vote is consistent with its stance on executive pay. The fund also opposed Musk’s record package last year.

Bloomberg says Wall Street CEOs are warning of a possible 10–15% equity correction in the next 12–24 months, saying valuations are “full, not cheap.”

Capital Group CEO Mike Gitlin said corporate earnings remain strong but “what’s challenging are valuations,” noting the S&P 500 trades at 23x forward earnings, well above its 5-year average of 20x.

On whether stocks are cheap, fair or fully valued, Gitlin said most people “would say we’re somewhere between fair and full, but I don’t think a lot of people would say we’re between cheap and fair." The same goes for credit spreads.

Goldman’s David Solomon and Morgan Stanley’s Ted Pick both said a pullback would be “a healthy development,” with Pick adding that “markets have come a long way, but there’s still policy error risk.”

Citadel’s Ken Griffin said “we are very deep into a bull market,” while Solomon added that “technology multiples are full” but advised clients to stay invested rather than try to time the market.

$GRAB Q3 revenue came in at $873M vs $871M consensus and adj. EBITDA hit $136M. Management raised 2025 guides to $3.38B–$3.40B revenue and $490M–$500M adj. EBITDA. On-demand GMV rose 24% YoY and MTUs reached 48M, though deliveries revenue was $465M vs $470M est.

From the call: growth is coming from “product-led” moves rather than heavier subsidies, with incentives flat to lower while transactions rose 27% and GrabUnlimited now over 20% of delivery MTUs. The loan book is ramping toward $1B by year-end with a $3.5B annualized disbursal run-rate, and management still expects fintech to break even in 2H with the banks at break even in Q4.

“Every job we’ve got is going to change in some way,” he said, adding that $WMT's AI push will reshape roles from “getting the shopping carts off the parking lot” to leadership. 

The company is training workers through its Walmart Academies and expanding AI use with ChatGPT meal planning and automation tools.

Q3 results: EPS $0.08 vs $0.11 est, revenue $113.2M vs $116.9M est, same-store sales -2.9%. CEO Kelli Valade said Denny’s “remains focused on agility and brand relevance” while navigating a challenging consumer environment.

BofA Raises $HIMS PT to $32 from $28 - Underperform

Analyst comments: "HIMS reported a mixed quarter with revenue and EBITDA exceeding Street and BofA estimates, while total subscribers came in below expectations. The Sexual Health business is driving the weakness in the core, and HIMS expects that to continue in the first half of 2026. It is difficult to assess how much of the weak performance in Sexual Health is due to the transition from episodic to daily subscriptions, but 40% subscriber growth excluding this business was better than expected.

Incremental subscribers were weak this quarter and investments are rising — both trends likely to continue for the next few quarters. We acknowledge that HIMS is investing for growth and believe these investments can help differentiate HIMS over time. We see downside risk to 2026 consensus revenue estimates and lower our 2026 EBITDA estimates, leading us to reiterate our Underperform rating.

We roll our valuation framework from 2025 to 2026 and maintain our ~22x multiple (2025 multiple increasing from 22x to 25x), with our price objective increasing to $32 from $28. The higher implied multiple reflects incremental confidence in HIMS’ strategy to verticalize the supply chain and invest in new verticals."

Getty Images $GETY won a UK court case against Stability AI, with judges ruling that the company’s Stable Diffusion model infringed both trademark and copyright laws.

The court found that Stability AI used Getty’s copyrighted photos to train its model and that its outputs unlawfully included Getty’s watermark. Responsibility was placed directly on the model provider, not individual users.

Getty said it plans to use this ruling to strengthen its ongoing U.S. lawsuit and called for clearer global rules requiring AI developers to disclose training data sources.

BofA Downgrades $DKNG to Neutral from Buy, Lowers PT to $35 from $48

Analyst comments: "In the last two years, DraftKings’ iGaming share has declined from 27% to 23%. FanDuel’s focus on iGaming has contributed to some share loss, but we believe DraftKings has underperformed its own expectations. Following a miss in Q1, we were hopeful iGaming execution would improve, but recent state data continues to materially lag peers.

Separately, 2026 could once again bring state-level tax headwinds. This has already pressured margins by roughly 200 basis points, and while we have accounted for ongoing pressure, the Street has been slow to do so. In the worst case, states could even attempt to offset PM cannibalization by raising taxes on incumbents."

Analyst: Shaun Kelley

$PLTR

Palantir put up one of the most exceptional quarters I have seen from any company, ever. 

To grow topline at 63% while growing operating margins to 51% and net income margins to 40% is a masterclass in efficient growth that I don't think the stock market has ever witnessed. 

The company has obviously put their foot in the ground and showed the market how AI is not only a tailwind for their business, but in the words of Alex Karp, "we own the market where value creation matters."

If we are talking about AI that is leading to transformational impact in the enterprise or on the battlefield, then the:

204 deals closed, 2.76B in TCV, 77% US Rev growth, 45% customer count growth, 114% on a Rule of 40 score shows that this is Palantir's market and they are absolutely dominating in it, even with less than only 1000 customers. 

Having said that, the stock did make a large move before earnings so the market taking it down after those results will lead people to believe it doesn't matter. 

Not much can be said for someone who gets upset that a stock which is already up 150%+ YTD goes down on earnings but for those that actual investors in Palantir and want to continue to see the business fundamental improve at the rapid scale that they are, this was the best quarter in the company's history.

$GRAB

GRAB Q3 2025 EARNINGS: 

- $873M revenue, +22% YoY 
- On-Demand GMV $5.8B, +24% YoY 
- Profit: $17M
- Adj. EBITDA: $136M, +51% YoY
- Adj. FCF (TTM): $283M
- 886M in loans, +56% YoY
- 48M monthly transacting users, +14% YoY

The company raised EBITDA guidance to $500M, up from $480M. 

This was an incredible earnings by Grab which continued to reinforce the bull case around their network effect leading to increased momentum around the most important parts of their business.

My core takeaways:

- Financial services is growing at a rapid pace and on track for 1B loans dispersed by EOY with a break even target for the entire segment by H2 2026. Management continues to grow this part of the business rapidly due to their ecosystem effect around being able to effectively underwrite the loans given all proprietary data they have on users which makes it seem like this growth will continue into 2026. 

- GrabUnlimited users hit an ATH, growing 14% YoY. This was very important to see given this is the largest subscription platform in all of SEA and also highlights the company's 6M YoY user growth. AT 48M MTUs, they are only about 7% of the region's population. As more users join, more topline growth can be expected going into 2026.

- Tourism is coming back and Anthony Tan spoke about how partnerships with various governments are creating strong incentives for Grab to play a pivotal role in the ecosystem around tourism in the entire region. Tan stressed that the company is NOT seeing issues with demand (in fact they had more demand than supply when it came to their drivers in Q3) and mgmt made sure for investors to understand their business is cyclical, they have a variety of tools at their fingers to really be able to effectively continue sustained growth. 

- Finally, new products are working. When Grab held their first product event earlier this year, they showcased a variety of new products that aimed to increase user engagement at scale. Grab’s new products like Saver Deliveries, Group Orders, and GrabMore are driving both user growth and deeper engagement. Cross-selling between Food and Mart services has led to 1.8x higher order frequency among multi-service users, showing stronger loyalty and higher lifetime value.

The number one question for me as a shareholder is what exactly they plan to do with their cash. They have $5.3B of net liquidity and either they are going to use that to scale financial services going into 2026 or they are going to acquire, but this is still the question I am curious about as 30% of the market cap in cash provides a cushion to investors but also should be used to continue funding growth.

Overall, I thought this was an exceptional quarter which is laying the framework for the company to continue growth over the coming years. Yes, the stock price may not be reflecting that at the moment (it doesn't help as the broader market is down) but I don't see the red flags or reason for the market to take it down in this quarter.

For those wanting a compounder that is relatively cheap for the value of a brand dominating an entire region, Grab continued to show their strength in this quarter.

S&P down over 1%

i see a few reasons going around but nothing with Trump or any big macro event that happened overnight

i guess choppy start to November to digest the gains from October?

Bernstein SocGen Group Raises $GRAB PT to $6.60 from $5.60 - Outperform

Analyst comments: "Grab continues to deliver consistent earnings as it leverages its dominant position to drive both growth and margins. We see multiple levers for expansion as the company deploys technology and its strong cash reserves to unlock new opportunities and expand its total addressable market.

A key strength of the Grab model lies in its complexity—building and sustaining a three-sided marketplace across 400 cities is not easily replicated. As a logistics-heavy business rather than a pure digital platform, Grab’s model also raises barriers to new entrants. Existing competitors are underfunded and losing ground, paving the way for consolidation.

This structural advantage allows Grab to play offense rather than defense, executing its strategy with consistency and control. We expect this competitive edge to endure."

Here’s what analysts have to say after $PLTR earnings:

**BofA (Buy; PT $255)**
“On the notion of real vs. fake AI – we continue to expect growth will accelerate as more enterprises and governments understand the choice in front of them. Palantir's ‘red pill’ model combines boot camps, deep FDE expertise, Ontology-driven ROI, and scalable deployment — versus competitors’ ‘blue pill’ wrappers. We continue to view this as a winning formula for enduring differentiation. Better-than-expected growth, unique GTM execution, and long-term durability drive our higher PT ($255, 15x EV/EBITDA 2035E unch.).”

**UBS (Neutral; PT $205)**
“Ninth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth (+63% y/y on a $4.7B scale) — a turnaround we’ve never seen before. The guide implies even faster 4Q growth (+67% model). U.S. commercial TCV $1.3B (+342%) boosts multi-year visibility. Fundamentals remain excellent, but valuation — 157× CY26 FCF — caps upside. The setup is powerful but already well-discounted.”

**Mizuho (Neutral; PT $205)**
“Q3 +63% y/y revenue (+830 bps beat, topping Q2’s +690 bps surprise). Management again raised FY guidance by more than the beat — a rarity. Both commercial and government segments inflecting higher. Yet the stock trades at ~64× 2027 revenue, well above any software peer. The risk is multiple reversion within quarters even as fundamentals stay stellar. PLTR remains uniquely positioned for AI and digital modernization trends.”

**Goldman Sachs (Neutral; PT $188)**
“Q3 revenue +8% vs Street; EBIT +500 bps vs cons.; Q4 guide +12% vs Street. Stock faded after hours (−4% from +5%) on high expectations and +175% YTD run. PLTR stands out as one of few software firms visibly monetizing AI today — larger deals, higher rev/customer. Balanced view: significant AIP share gains offset by ecosystem risk if custom builds give way to off-the-shelf models. Valuation extreme (~80× ’26 EV/Sales, >150× EV/FCF). Neutral maintained.”

**Baird (Neutral; PT $200)**
“Q3 strong across the board: total rev +63% y/y (vs +48% Q2); U.S. Commercial +121% and U.S. Gov +52%. Q4 guide (+61% rev, 53% margin) above consensus. The AI thesis continues to deliver, but valuation leaves little room for error. Execution A-grade; multiple B-risk.”

**Jefferies (Underperform; PT $70)**
“U.S. demand booming and the print was outstanding (+63% rev, +121% U.S. commercial). CY25 guide raised across metrics (rev +54%, U.S. comm +104%, OPM 49%). Still, risk/reward is unfavorable at ~83× CY26E rev. We admire the execution but prefer AI exposure via MSFT/SNOW.”

**RBC Capital Markets (Underperform; PT $50)**
“Strong quarter (+63% rev, R40 114%), but growth remains U.S.-centric and concentrated. Intl commercial +10% y/y, bookings heavily U.S. AI multi-year contracts that may pull forward demand. Profitability robust, but visibility into normalized growth is low. Valuation elevated; growth profile concentrated. PT based on 21× CY26E sales, 48× EV/CY26E FCF.”

KARP ON $PLTR SHORT SELLERS:

When I hear shorts attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America, It's crazy motivating & I'll tell you why they are getting screwed by Palantir

Every time they short, we triple down on getting the better numbers and part, honestly, to make them poorer.

These people they could pick on any company in the world, but they have to pick on the one that actually helps people, that actually has made money for the average person, that is actually supporting our warfighters.  

They are in the business of being skeptical and wrong, we are in the business of giving an unfair advantage to American workers, American war fighters, and our investors.

$YUM Brands said it’s reviewing strategic options for Pizza Hut, which could include a sale, joint venture, or partial stake divestiture, as the chain continues to lag. 

Q3 same-store sales for Pizza Hut fell 1%, while Taco Bell rose 7% and KFC gained 3%. Pizza Hut’s U.S. market share fell to 18.7% from 22.6% in 2019.

CEO Chris Turner said the brand’s “full value may be better realized outside of Yum.”

The median age for first-time homebuyers in the U.S. has reached 40, the highest on record, as rising prices and mortgage rates continue to delay homeownership. 

First-time buyers now make up just 21% of all home purchases, the lowest share since 1981, while the median existing home price stands at $415,200, up more than 50% since 2019.

The National Association of Realtors estimates that losing a decade of homeownership could cost roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. Repeat buyers are older, with a median age of 62, and often wealthier, paying cash or making larger down payments.

Raymond James Reiterates Market Perform Rating on $PLTR

Analyst comments: "Palantir delivered a standout 3Q25 driven by record U.S. Commercial momentum, accelerating U.S. Government execution, and a sharp inflection in deal activity. Revenue of $1.181B (+63% year-over-year) topped consensus by roughly 10%, with adjusted operating income of $601M (51% margin), adjusted free cash flow of $540M (46% margin), and a Rule-of-40 score of 114%.

U.S. Commercial revenue surged 121% year-over-year and 29% quarter-over-quarter to $397M — its highest quarterly contribution yet — while U.S. Government revenue climbed 52% year-over-year to $486M, supported by the continued ramp of large defense programs. Momentum appears sustainable, as Palantir closed a record number of large deals (204 at $1M+, 91 at $5M+, and 53 at $10M+) and posted its largest-ever U.S. Commercial total contract value at $1.31B (+342% year-over-year), underscoring expanding enterprise adoption of AIP.

Management raised guidance across revenue, margins, and free cash flow (FY25 revenue $4.396–4.400B; adjusted operating income $2.15–2.155B; adjusted FCF $1.9–2.1B). That said, Palantir was priced to perfection, and valuation still sits at 85x 2026 sales (versus 7x in 2023), despite trading lower on the print. With this valuation in tow, we maintain our Market Perform rating, opting to admire what is looking like a historic race to the top of the market-cap echelon of public companies — although we wonder what could cause a pullback to make valuation and expectations more digestible."

The response from this PRC rep is so dramatic, very theater-kid coded.

"Palmer Luckey recently said that the Chinese mainland will likely launch military action on Taiwan in 2027. He opposes the US' involvement in the war and said that Taiwan should be made into a 'super-hairy porcupine'. What's your comment?"

"The Taiwan question is China's internal affair and should not be interfered with by any external forces. Such remarks once again expose that some in the United States are trying to make Taiwan a chess piece and destroy it out of their own political and economic interests. If they continue to do so, they will only push Taiwan and Taiwan compatriots to perilous war. Taiwan belongs to China. We will not let the Democratic Progressive Party authorities collude with external forces and turn Taiwan into hell."

People Inc. (formerly Dotdash Meredith) has signed an AI licensing deal with Microsoft, joining Gannett as a launch partner in Microsoft’s $MSFT new pay-per-use Publisher Content Marketplace, the company announced during IAC’s Q3 earnings call.

The company said its traffic from Google Search has dropped to about 24%, down from 60% when it merged in 2021, as Google’s AI Overviews have reduced referral traffic and weakened programmatic ad revenue. Despite that decline, People Inc. posted its eighth straight quarter of digital growth, with digital revenue up 9% to $269 million.

China 🇨🇳 has reportedly issued guidance requiring state funded data centers under early construction to use only domestically made AI chips, according to Reuters. 

Projects that are less than 30% complete have been told to remove foreign chips or cancel planned purchases. 

The policy applies to Nvidia’s H20 as well as B200 and H200 chips, and could significantly reduce remaining foreign chip demand in state backed infrastructure. 

Local suppliers such as Huawei, Cambricon, MetaX and Enflame are expected to benefit.

$GOOGL and Epic Games have settled their long-running antitrust dispute.

Terms were not fully disclosed, but both companies told the court the agreement will support more developer choice and lower fees on Android.

The settlement keeps the court-ordered rule allowing developers to offer payments outside Google Play with commission caps of 9% or 20%. It also replaces the earlier requirement for Google to share its full app catalog with a system for “registered app stores” that will receive equal treatment on Android devices.

The settlement also resolves related litigation between Epic and Samsung. Both sides now await final court approval.

Roth/MKM Downgrades $UUUU to Sell from Neutral, Raises PT to $11.50 from $7.25

Analyst comments: "In July 2025, we downgraded Energy Fuels to Neutral as we believed the company’s market value was in line with the fundamental value of its assets. At that time, shares traded at $6.51. Since then, enthusiasm around rare earth and uranium-focused companies drove Energy Fuels’ share price to a high of $27.33 in mid-October, despite no material changes to its underlying assets, no direct government investments, and continued losses. While we remained Neutral during the run-up due to strong market momentum and a lack of near-term catalysts for a correction, we now see that momentum fading. With multiple financial studies expected before year-end 2025 or early 2026 and sector sentiment likely peaking, we believe it is time for investors to take profits if they have not already done so."

Needham Raises $CYRX PT to $12.00 from $11.00, Maintains Buy Rating

Analyst comments: "CryoPort’s third-quarter 2025 revenue exceeded consensus expectations, driven by strong performance in Life Sciences Services, and management raised its 2025 revenue guidance. Notably, commentary indicates potential incremental upside to Street estimates for 2026 revenue. CryoPort continues to make progress toward adjusted EBITDA profitability, which could still be achieved in the fourth quarter of 2025. Given the company’s continued strength and potential upside to 2026 projections, we reiterate our Buy rating and raise our price target to $12."

UBS Raises $AMD PT to $300 from $265 - Buy

Analyst comments: "With AMD hosting its first Analyst Day since before ChatGPT next week, there was little new in earnings to shift the broader debate, and that proved true. Given the rally in shares ahead of the report, a short-term pullback is possible, but we would not look to time it given likely positive updates at the Analyst Day. AMD is expected to outline a path toward $15 to $20 in EPS later this decade, with AWS potentially serving as an additional catalyst, possibly at re:Invent in early December.

As for results, AMD delivered a revenue beat and guided above expectations, though some AI GPU shipments appeared pulled forward from calendar Q4 into Q3, possibly due to Oracle. Importantly, AMD dispelled concerns that its AI GPU business might face a first-half 2026 slowdown while reaffirming that GPU sales will be weighted toward the second half due to the OpenAI ramp. While investors remain focused on AI GPU momentum, we note that agentic AI is also driving a strong refresh of traditional compute infrastructure, which we estimate will account for over 35% of AMD’s EPS in 2026, positioning the company as the key beneficiary given Intel’s lack of a competitive roadmap."

Raymond James Lowers $SMCI PT to $50 from $53 - Outperform

Analyst comments: "Supermicro negatively preannounced results on October 23, calling for sales of ~$5B vs. its prior forecast for $6–7B. Margin weakness will undoubtedly remain the focal point, and shares were trading down ~10% after hours. The weak F2Q26 margin guidance reflects some unique foundational expenses related to capacity expansion, as Supermicro prepares to scale its operations ahead of expected revenue growth. Management remains confident that it is laying the groundwork for eventual margin expansion through higher volumes and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. Despite this, the timeline for improvement remains vague and investors likely remain weary. Our price target goes to $50, reflecting the intermediate-term margin headwinds."

The volume of US corporate bonds that’ve been downgraded from investment-grade to junk has climbed to $42B this year (vs $6B last year), per Barclays.

Barclays also mentioned the share of BBB / BBB- names on negative outlook is now near the highest level in ~10 years, that means there’s a bigger pipeline of potential fallen angels building.

Estimates put next year’s downgrades in the $70B–$90B range.

One name getting attention is Ford, with ~$46B of IG-index bonds, which could become the largest fallen angel on record if another downgrade hits.

Evercore ISI Lowers $MTCH PT to $35 from $38 - In Line

Analyst comments: "Match group reported in-line Q3 revenue, a solid 9% Q3 EBITDA beat (excluding a litigation settlement charge), and offered mixed Q4 guidance (revenue midpt 2% below the Street, EBITDA midpt 3% above). Per management, MTCH has now completed the 'reset' phase of its turnaround plan (changing the culture and accelerating operating and product cadence) and early results from product tests and investments have been encouraging. 

The company is currently evaluating 2026 capital deployment priorities and plans a spring 'relaunch' of Tinder, following 'Project Aurora,' a large-scale test of a reimagined Tinder experience now underway in Australia. 

Management also increased their estimate of 2026 iOS IAP savings to $90MM from $65MM prior (with line of sight to an additional $10–15MM of Android-related savings on a recent Play Store policy change), though it remains unclear if some of the savings will be redeployed into product or marketing. 

While we have layered the full $90MM of savings into our revised 2026 Adj. EBITDA estimate of $1.38B, we also see a fairly wide range of potential Adj. EBITDA outcomes for 2026 depending on management’s still pending strategy and capital allocation moves."

RBC Capital Lowers $PINS PT to $38 from $45 - Outperform

Analyst comments: "PINS had a disappointing Q3 print. Tariff-related weakness showed up for the first time in our digital ads universe and will reinforce PINS' lack of customer diversity for the bears and higher macro sensitivity. Lowering ests and price target moves to $38.

Key positives: 1) Further solid evidence of product improvement with Performance+ retail advertisers seeing 24% higher conversion and 12% higher monthly spending growth rates, 2) Engagement growth continues with 16% user growth and 40% impression growth which was encouraging though largely coming from ARPU-dilutive geos.

Key negatives: 1) Pullbacks from some large advertisers owed to home furnishing-related tariffs drove the Q4 guide down with it being unclear if Amazon was a part of that weakness, and could call the 3p retail media auction density thesis into question (see our intra-qtr ad load which showed Amazon down meaningfully). While tariffs was a known risk, intra-qtr communications on tariffs may drive some outsized reaction here. 2) Anecdotes of product-related improvements are encouraging but selected examples of outsized growth continuing to not foot with overall reported numbers remains a challenge. 3) The expected 2H margin expansion < 1H is playing out but the implied Q4 leverage appears minimal which won't instill confidence in next year's expansion. 4) Management stuck to its long-term targets where mid/high teens on revenue could be looked at as less achievable & with capitulation still to come. We stick with PINS at Outperform given our views that a comfortable LT double digit grower with margin expansion should trade higher than an implied single digit EBITDA multiple on '27 numbers - though we acknowledge the product cycle story may be on ice for the time being."

BofA Raises $SNDK PT to $230 from $125 - Buy 

Analyst comments: "We are raising our estimates and PO on Sandisk to $230 as 1) higher than previously expected demand from data centers starting to meaningfully impact pricing, 2) expected medium-term undersupply of HDDs is driving higher demand for eSSD products, 3) higher confidence in SNDK’s growing penetration of eSSD market, and 4) low appetite from NAND suppliers to increase capacity in the near-term. We expect the price to BV multiple to rerate from 0.8x-2x to 3x-4x for the next few years on higher revenue growth with all-time high profitability levels. Reit Buy on valuation, undervalued JV assets, eSSD share gains in C26, & long-term potential for industry consolidation."

Goldman Sachs Lowers $CAVA PT to $68 from $74 - Neutral

Analyst comments: "CAVA reported 3Q25 SSSG of +1.9% vs. GS/VA of +2.5%/+2.6%, with management calling out lower frequency among younger consumers, while unit growth tracked in-line with our estimates at 415 stores at quarter end. Lower G&A (with lower performance-based incentive compensation) helped to mostly offset higher-than-expected restaurant expenses, which flowed through to adjusted EPS of $0.14, in-line with our estimates. Bottom-line: We continue to believe in CAVA's long-term growth potential amid the company's focus on delivering an exceptional guest experience through operational enhancements (technology, equipment, new Assistant General Manager role), culinary innovation, and a re-imagined CAVA Rewards program. That said, we think this is balanced by near-term, industry-wide macro pressures that we expect to weigh on traffic, including the intense promotional environment as well as challenges faced by the younger consumer cohort (aged 25 to 35) driving more cautious spending. We also acknowledge a "honeymoon effect" from outsized 2024/2025 openings, which we expect to continue in 2026. As a result, we remain Neutral rated on CAVA with a new $68, 12m TP."

Morgan Stanley says $GOOGL Cloud could grow 50%+ in 2026. Their updated model shows Google’s $158B backlog (with ~55% recognized over 2 years) plus continued growth in on-demand workloads could drive the acceleration. 

On-demand has been growing ~25% this year, and if Google adds ~$50B+ in net backlog next year, total cloud revenue growth could clear 50%. Even more conservative assumptions still point to similar upside. MS views Cloud as the key driver of GOOGL re-rating.

$FTNT LAUNCHES NEW AI DATA CENTER SECURITY STACK

Fortinet rolled out a Secure AI Data Center solution built around a new FortiGate 3800G firewall designed for high-density GPU data centers. 

The hardware supports 400GbE, up to ~800 Gbps firewall throughput, ~210 Gbps IPsec, and ~200M concurrent sessions, aiming to handle AI cluster traffic loads.

The broader framework adds protections for LLM environments like prompt injection safeguards, data leakage controls, and quantum-safe encryption options. 

Fortinet says the architecture also lowers power use vs traditional setups.

$GOOGL | Morgan Stanley says Google Cloud could grow 50%+ in 2026

Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told investors that the bank’s updated backlog model “outlines [a] path to 50%+ Google Cloud revenue growth in ’26,” representing “mid single digit+ % upside to us and 15%+ upside to Street.”

Morgan Stanley’s sensitivity analysis shows that if Google adds about “$50bn+ in net backlog in ’26” and the on-demand business grows 15% or more, total cloud revenue growth could exceed 50 percent.

Even under more conservative assumptions, “25% Y/Y growth in on demand” and a “$20bn step-up in backlog,” the model still supports 50 percent-plus growth, Nowak stated.

Raymond James Raises $KTOS PT to $97 from $80 - Strong Buy 

Analyst comments: "The company stacked business wins in 3Q that increase our confidence that Kratos can double its revenue base over the next three years or so. Kratos’ 3Q25 results again exceeded expectations, highlighted by double-digit organic growth, healthy B2B > 1.0x, and continued healthy margins. Management raised its fullyear revenue forecast, reiterated its EBITDA target, and provided an 2026-27 framework that remains conservative in our view given the company’s record backlog, expanding international opportunities, and accelerating mix shift from development to production. Our model remains perched above the 2026 and 2027 guide. The stock is trading off due to another 2H-weighted year reflecting cost pressure from legacy fixed-price target drone contracts and heavier bid-and-proposal spending. Likewise, while the full-year top-line guide went higher, EBITDA remained flat and cash burn is a bit high — all signaling another investment year. After shares have more than doubled since June (vs. S&P 500 up 15%), the stock is taking a breather as shares were priced for perfection, the chart consolidates in a healthy manner, and investors book some profits. We view this pullback as an opportunity to pick up shares on a business with strong multi-year growth visibility via long term contracts almost perfectly aligned to national security priorities including unmanned systems, hypersonics, engines, air defense, and space."

Amazon $AMZN is testing a new Whole Foods format in Plymouth Meeting, PA, where the store now includes a 10,000 sq ft micro-fulfillment center that stocks items Whole Foods normally doesn’t carry.

Shoppers can scan a code and order from ~12,000 additional products like Tide Pods, Goldfish, and Kraft Mac & Cheese for pickup in-store.

The fulfillment system uses robotics from startup Fulfil, and Amazon says it may expand the model to more locations.

Google Maps is adding Gemini directly into navigation. 

Drivers will be able to ask conversational questions while on the road (e.g., find restaurants along the route, check parking, report traffic). 

Maps will also use Street View data to give landmark-based directions instead of distance cues. 

Rollout begins in the US over the coming weeks on iOS and Android, with Android Auto support to follow.

Netflix $NFLX says its ad-supported tier now reaches 190M monthly active viewers globally. 

The company is also testing interactive and dynamic ad formats with WWE now and plans to use dynamic ad insertion for the NFL Christmas game before scaling more broadly in 2026.

Note: It introduced the MAV metric to better reflect real ad reach (viewing at least one minute of ads, adjusted for household size).

MCDONALD'S $MCD ON CONSUMER:

“We continue to see a bifurcated consumer base.”

“QSR traffic from lower-income consumers declining, nearly double digits in the 3rd quarter, a trend that’s persisted for nearly two years.”

“We believe the pressures will continue well into 2026.”

“Traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double digits in the quarter.”

“The Q3 data only continued to emphasize and maybe even showed that bifurcation extending.”

“Low-income consumer was down high single-digit in visits; high-income consumer was up high single-digit.”

IT’S $HOOD EARNINGS DAY

WHAT ARE WE THINKING FOLKS 🥶

Robinhood is the best performing stock in the S&P 500 — they’ve obviously had an incredible year and executed beyond imagination.

Given the stock is only $10 off ATHs, I’m not sure how strong the earnings have to be in order to see a big move, but as someone who genuinely is long, I just want to see continued execution at scale.

I think we are going to hear commentary across a variety of new verticals that have launched/are launching soon, including banking and prediction markets.

Analysts are expecting 90% revenue growth which I believe they will get to at around $1.2B, if they can beat that number then it’ll be a really strong quarter but they are building a very diversified business attempting to be the core future of financial services.

Just as excited for this earnings as the first public quarter I covered for them when they were $10 (Q4 2023) and I was just hoping we could see a push to $15, times have changed but their execution continues to be at a level that is just incredible to witness.

Apple $AAPL is finalizing a deal to use $GOOGL's 1.2T-parameter Gemini model to power new Siri capabilities starting in 2026. 

Apple would pay Google ~ $1B/yr for the model, which will run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute so data stays on Apple servers.

Gemini will handle Siri’s planning and summarization, while Apple continues developing its own large model with a goal to eventually replace Google.

$AAPL $GOOGL

BREAKING: Apple is finalizing a deal to pay Google about $1B a year to integrate its 1.2 trillion-parameter Gemini AI model into Siri, as per Bloomberg. 

The upgraded Siri is expected to launch in 2026.

What an absolute monster year for Google...

Two former $META employees have launched Sandbar, and their first device is Stream, a smart ring for quiet voice capture. 

You tap and hold the touchpad and whisper your thought, and it converts it into a note or sends it to an AI assistant. 

The ring also works as a music controller for play, pause, skip, and volume. Preorders start at $249 with shipments planned for next summer.

There's a capacity issue in the US high-protein yogurt market

Danone says demand for high-protein yogurt in the US is running so hot that they literally can’t produce enough. Half of their US yogurt lineup is Greek and mostly high-protein, and sales have surged even more with the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

Because of this, Danone has been slower to launch new yogurt products and expand distribution. The company is now adding capacity at several US facilities, including Minster, Ohio, but supply will likely stay tight until that comes online.

Danone says demand for high-protein yogurt in the US is running so hot that they literally can’t produce enough. 

Because of that, they’ve been slower rolling out new products and even had to limit distribution on some SKUs since plants are already maxed.

The company is now adding capacity at several US facilities, including Minster, Ohio, but supply will likely stay tight until that comes online.

Note: Half of their US yogurt lineup is Greek and mostly high-protein, and sales have surged even more with the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

$SNAP is partnering with Perplexity to bring its AI answer engine into Snapchat in early 2026.

Perplexity will be accessible directly in Chat, offering conversational, source-linked answers alongside Snap’s existing My AI.

Perplexity will pay Snap $400M over a year (cash + equity) as the integration rolls out globally. 

Snap says this is its first large-scale integration of an external AI partner and expects revenue contribution to begin in 2026.

$NVDA CEO Jensen told the FT that China is likely to win the AI race because its companies have cheaper power and fewer regulatory hurdles. 

He said the US and UK are slowing themselves down with what he called “cynicism” around AI and a patchwork of new state rules.

Huang pointed out that China is actively subsidizing data center energy costs, saying for companies there “power is free.”

Illumina $ILMN says China will lift its ban on importing its DNA sequencers starting Nov 10, reversing restrictions put in place earlier this year amid tariff retaliation.

The company is still on China’s “unreliable entity list,” but CEO Jacob Thaysen called the move a positive step and said Illumina will work toward a longer-term resolution.

Greater China was ~8.5% of revenue in 2023. Illumina is not changing its 2025 guidance following the update.

like I am at a loss for words at how they are decreasing costs, increasing margins, expanding into new verticals, BUYING BACK shares, and still growing topline at triple digits

stock is flat because it’s up a ton this year, but my goodness what a quarter

Chipmaker Nexperia says it has halted supply to its China manufacturing unit after the local team refused to make required payments and did not follow corporate governance directives. 

The company has warned customers it cannot guarantee the quality or authenticity of chips produced at the China facility since October 13.

Nexperia also accused the unit of misusing company seals and opening unauthorized bank accounts to divert funds.

The company said facilities outside China are operating normally. The situation follows weeks of operational disruption after the Dutch government temporarily took control of Nexperia and China blocked exports of some products. 

Nexperia says it expects to resolve the governance dispute and remains committed to its operations in China.

Piper Sandler Downgrades $ELF to Neutral from Overweight, Lowers PT to $100 from $150

Analyst comments: "While strong momentum at rhode is continuing (40% growth expected in FY26, strength across categories), 3-4% sales growth implied for core ELF in FY26 is disappointing and not deserving of a premium multiple, in our view, considering resilience of the category (improved to +2% vs. -1% in F1Q26), easing comparisons, comments about strength in innovation and struggling competitive set in mass. Profitability is also resetting, with EBITDA margin guided for a 200+ bps decline, with lack of clarity on further investment cycle that may be necessary at rhode. Stock is under pressure after hours but is still pricey at 32x FY26 guide (and 30x our FY27 est.)--while rhode sales could see upside this year (Sephora UK launches next week), in absence of the core business rebounding beyond MSD, we think the multiple could re-rate lower."

BofA Raises $QCOM PT to $215 from $200 - Buy

Analyst comments: "The strong results are supported by handset strength in China, attributed to timing of the Chinese holiday and product launches, as well as solid performance in non-handsets and long-term opportunities in data centers. However, the intermediate term outlook is somewhat challenged, with some of the handset strength being cyclical and potentially short-lived. The smartphones semiconductors, an ex-growth industry, still represents 71% of QCT revenues, having multiple aspects of peak activity. Chinese vendors account for ~68% of handset QCT revenues; there are signs of self-development at Xiaomi; Samsung share expected to decline in F2Q from 100% to 75%; and Apple contract ending in about one year. As IoT, Auto, and Data Centers ramp, the stock multiple should expand, but handset concentration is the key transitory risk."

Analyst comments: "We upgrade Bunge to OW due to a higher LT margin, following the completion of the Viterra merger resulting in less dilution than feared. We are confident in the company's ability to realize synergies from the deal and drive better mid-cycle earnings, paired with BG's general outperformance vs peers – seen again this quarter. 3Q adj. profits outperformed our expectations with FY25 guidance maintained despite macro uncertainty, with management believing that the new diversified model will allow for improved logistics and margin capture. 2026 should bring additional vertical integration benefits, leading to BG outperforming peers over the next year."

Deutsche Bank Upgrades $GXO to Buy from Hold, Raises PT to $64 from $52

Analyst comments: "The market's increasing interest in European-levered companies, with GXO as the sole US Transportation firm significantly exposed to the EU (~2/3 of its business is in Europe). Its key value proposition: enabling greater productivity enhancement for customers through increased warehouse automation. With protectionist policies gaining traction, companies in developed markets will likely face increasing pressure to find savings as access to lower-cost labor and manufacturing in developing markets diminishes. GXO offers such efficiencies in the form of using “automated sortation” and “intelligent robotics” to complete order fulfillment and reverse logistics for corporate supply chains."

Reuters reports $GOOGL is planning a major AI data center on Christmas Island (Australia), following its cloud deal with the Australian Department of Defence. Google is in talks to lease land near the island airport and secure power through a local mining partner.

The island is seen as strategically important for monitoring activity in the Indian Ocean. Analysts say a local AI data center could support forward command-and-control and unmanned systems, especially if satellite links are disrupted.

Google has also applied to build a subsea cable connecting Christmas Island to Darwin. The project is still undergoing local review, with the community weighing economic benefits vs. increased defense presence.

William Blair says Costco’s $COST October comps were strong, and what stands out is that Costco intentionally reduced both the depth and breadth of seasonal items like toys and holiday decor that lean on China sourcing, and shifted more space to apparel and home goods that stay relevant past the holidays. 

Store checks show noticeably lighter Halloween and Christmas displays than prior years, yet conversion held.

Analysts say this speaks to Costco’s merchandising discipline and ability to pivot assortment without losing momentum. Blair views the result as a positive read for holiday demand at the higher-income level.

The broader consumer setup remains split: higher-income households are still spending, while lower-income trends are weakening. Blair expects a more bifurcated holiday season with clear winners and losers. Costco’s value positioning, limited SKU model, and higher-income member mix place it firmly in the “winner” category.

BofA on $APP (Buy, PT $860): 'Solid Q3 print, but few details of eCommerce ramp available'

"Q3 revenues were +12% Q/Q, ahead of BofA/Street/Guide of 10%/7%/6%. The print exceeded the median of investors we spoke with, although 1/3 had much higher expectations." 

"Management pointed to incremental gaming model improvements as the driver of the beat and noted that eCommerce remained small. We estimated Q3 eCommerce Net Revenue of $140mn. That eCommerce would not move the needle was well known pre-print. EBITDA margin of 81% was in line with Street/BofA/Guide. 4Q25 revenue guidance of $1.6bn at the high end was below BofA and investors we spoke with pre-print." 

"Management indicated that forecasting eCommerce net revenue in Q4 was difficult because of the influx of new advertisers since its self-serve (referral) launch on October 1. Nonetheless, the guide incorporates favorable mobile game advertiser seasonality, a contribution from international audiences, and continued model self-learning." 

"Newly onboarded advertiser spent less, in aggregate than the first eCommerce cohort; we model $43mn (vs. $83mn Dec ’24). We now assume that by December ‘25, 2400 advertisers will be live, although spend per advertiser will likely be $65K."

First thing that happens when AVs come in is they expand the market.

You would expect the unit economics… would favor AVs over time… variable cost… is relatively low… you would expect insurance to be lower as well.

We like the economics of [AVs] a lot and think… from the start [it’s] going to be accretive. And then we’ll get better from there.

BofA Upgrades $DOCN to Buy from Underperform, Raises PT to $60 from $34

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading shares of Digital Ocean (DO) from Underperform to Buy given (1) Preliminary revenue guide for 2026 approaching 20% growth, (2) Improved visibility and conviction in demand including signing multiple 8-figure deals (new for DO), (3) Expanding capacity rapidly that will support growth into 2026/2027, (4) Operating leverage should drive strong EBITDA growth, (5) FCF (levered) margins in the mid to high teens better than peers ramping infrastructure capacity, and (6) Sustained growth from high usage customer cohorts driving ARR acceleration."

Analyst: Wamsi Mohan

VIAVI $VIAV and Calnex are partnering to offer integrated lab testbeds for Open RAN equipment, combining VIAVI’s TM500/XEdge/TeraVM with Calnex’s Paragon-neo and SNE platforms. 

The setups allow O-RU/O-DU/O-CU vendors to test interoperability, timing, and network impairments in-house, aiming to avoid single-vendor testing that often breaks in real-world networks.

Charles Schwab is acquiring Forge Global $FRGE for about $660M in cash, paying $45 per share. 

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.

Forge runs a private market trading platform where investors have transacted over $17B in private company shares. Schwab says the acquisition will help expand access to private market investing for its retail and advisor clients, adding liquidity and data transparency to an area that has historically been limited to institutions.

Forge’s major shareholders, including Motive Capital and Deutsche Börse, have agreed to support the deal.

$PENN Entertainment and ESPN are ending their ESPN BET partnership early, effective Dec. 1, 2025. The deal originally ran 10 years with $150M annual payments, but the companies agreed to wind it down after the platform didn’t reach targeted market share.

PENN will rebrand its U.S. sportsbook to theScore Bet, aligning it with theScore media app (~4M MAUs). ESPN says it drove ~2.9M users to PENN during the partnership and will now explore other opportunities in sports betting.

BofA Securities Raises $SNAP PT to $10.00 from $9.50 - Neutral

Analyst comments: "We are encouraged by Snap’s steady progress in diversifying its revenue base and significant new revenue contribution from Perplexity deal. However, advertising still represents over 80% of total revenue, and growth rates reflect intensifying competition and sluggish usage trends. Positives could include cost management upside in 2026, while risk is a pressure on users from cost optimization initiatives and new social media age verification safeguards. At an after-hours price of $8.37, stock is valued at 10x our 2027E EBITDA & 16x FCF, not including SBC expense. Reiterate Neutral."

Microsoft $MSFT said it is pursuing a more powerful form of AI called “superintelligence”

Mustafa Suleyman, chief of the Microsoft AI group, will lead what the company is calling the MAI Superintelligence Team that will target hypothetical milestones that are even more ambitious than artificial general intelligence

“If AGI is often seen as the point at which an AI can match human performance at all tasks, then superintelligence is when it can go far beyond that performance,”

(Source Bloomberg)

Microsoft $MSFT is now moving ahead on developing superintelligence after its new agreement with OpenAI cleared the restrictions that previously prevented it from pursuing AGI-level systems on its own. 

Mustafa Suleyman announced that he will lead a new MAI Superintelligence Team, focused on building AI that can outperform humans in tasks related to materials science, medicine, clean energy and personal AI agents.

Suleyman said the goal is what he calls humanist superintelligence, meaning powerful systems designed to advance practical breakthroughs, not just push model size.

potential reasons for the move down today in markets:

- if the supreme court ruling on trump tariffs goes against him, the US would have to refund $1T+ worth of revenues/deals

- gov shutdown getting ready to shut down entire airports

- jensen said China can beat the United States in AI, not the best headline for semis

- worst october for layoffs since 2003, labor market fears potentially getting worse

Hurricanes have long shaped America’s coastlines—and its history. From the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane with 184 mph winds to modern storms like Katrina and Michael, these massive systems have caused immense destruction ⚠️

While forecasting and infrastructure have improved, rising ocean temperatures are fueling stronger, more frequent storms.

Here, we've partnered with [@​Inigo_Insurance](<https://twitter.com/Inigo_Insurance>) to rank the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history.

Bernstein Identifies 'Next Growth Vectors' at $HOOD (Outperform, $160 PT)

"Next growth vectors - Prediction markets & Crypto exchange! Quarter after quarter, Robinhood management raises the bar and tells us why the stock deserves its valuation. 

How do you model a company that adds couple of $100Mn revenue businesses every year? Consider these metrics - Life-time high quarterly revenue (100% YoY, 29% Seq.), $333bn platform assets (119% YoY, 19% Seq.) and lifetime high 26.8mn users and 3.9mn Gold users (77% YoY).

HOOD beat our street-high estimates by 3% on revenue (5% beat vs. consensus) and 12% on EPS (18% beat vs. consensus). This quarter apart from record trading revenues, Robinhood presented two more $100mn revenue businesses that just 6 months back, would not form a material part of any street model - Prediction markets and Bitstamp crypto exchange."

JPMorgan says Bitcoin could reach ~$170K in the next 6–12 months. 

Their team notes the big leverage washouts in perpetual futures (including the record Oct 10 liquidations) look mostly done, and BTC’s volatility vs gold has improved. To match private-sector gold holdings on a risk-adjusted basis, BTC’s market cap would need to rise ~67%.

SAM ALTMAN:

“We expect to end this year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030. We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years.”

Altman officially confirming $20B of OpenAI FY 2025 revenues.

Trying to combat the broader argument around lack of revenues vs the amount of spending commitments they have.

If they can scale revenues to “hundreds of billions,” by 2030, one can try to make sense of the spending commitments.

ELON MUSK: 

“One thing I’m trying to figure out is how to make enough chips, maybe we’ll work with Intel, but even whe we extrapolate the best case scenario for chip production form our suppliers. it is still not enough. I cant see any other way to get to the volume of chips we are looking for, so i think we will have to build a gigantic chip fab.”

$IONQ has advanced to Stage B in DARPA’s quantum benchmarking program. This stage requires a full roadmap through 2033 for utility-scale quantum systems. IonQ systems already run on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and they’ve outlined targets of ~2M physical qubits and ~80k logical qubits by 2030. Stage C will require proving the system can actually be built and operated.

$NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says the company is not planning to ship Blackwell AI chips to China.

He clarified that when he said “China will win,” he meant they have strong capabilities in this new tech, not that Nvidia was favoring them.

Huang also said it’s “up to China” if Nvidia products ever return to that market.

KeyBanc Upgrades $DDOG to Overweight from Sector Weight, Sets PT at $230

Analyst comments: "We upgrade shares of Datadog to Overweight as the two areas of concern that kept us at Sector Weight have materialized positively: (1) revenue excluding OpenAI accelerated, with strength broad-based; and (2) visibility into sustained OpenAI spend has improved following its renewed and expanded commitment in 3Q. We believe the positive growth inflection will continue given Datadog’s innovation leadership, platform breadth, relevance with AI-native companies, increasing success with security, accelerating public cloud trends, and monitoring of AI workloads as they move to inference."

Truist Securities Upgrades $GMED to Buy from Hold, Raises PT to $93 from $65

Analyst comments: "We upgrade Globus Medical to Buy as we have higher confidence in mid-single- to high-single-digit revenue growth and low- to mid-teens EPS growth given: (1) NVRO accretion is being pulled forward nearly one year ahead of expectations, reducing downside and integration risk to the P&L, and (2) accelerating trends within core spine, which more than offset a lower Enabling Technology outlook due to a more cautious capital backdrop. We see GMED earning $4.75 in 2027 EPS (vs. $4.09 prior), reflecting a 16% EPS CAGR from 2024–2027 on approximately 6% organic revenue growth and a 31.5% EBITDA margin (vs. 30.7% in 2025E)—a profile we view as worth at least 11x EBITDA, in line with peers. We raise our price target to $93 from $65."

CHINA EXPORTS FELL IN OCTOBER

China’s exports slipped 1.1% in October, reversing September’s +8.3%. Shipments to the US were down sharply again, falling about 25% last month, marking the seventh straight month of double digit declines. Imports were up only 1% as the domestic economy remains soft.

Stifel Upgrades $PENN to Buy from Hold, Raises PT to $21 from $19

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading PENN to Buy from Hold, and raising our target price to $21. Our value-unlock thesis outlined here was predicated on an ESPN Bet exit and pivot to iCasino-led digital strategy, which we got today ahead of schedule. B&M fundamentals remain stable since inflecting Q2, proving out resilience yet again amidst softening demand elsewhere in GL&L, with encouraging initial trends at Joliet & line-of-sight to annualization of new competitive opening headwinds. Pushback on our upgrade call will undoubtably be 'what's the catalyst to re-rate?' with PENN surprisingly underperforming on the announcement, though we see room for shares to grind steadily into the $20s with an attractive NTM catalyst path still left: 1) annualization of new competitive casino openings & resulting B&M inflection, 2) proof points of attractive return on project spend, 3) steady iCasino share ramp potentially accelerated by re-allocated financial/operational resources, and 4) Interactive asset monetization optionality."

Expedia $EXPE is ripping +16% this morning after a strong Q3 and a guidance raise. The big story is their B2B travel platform, which grew 26% y/y and is now the key driver of margins and bookings momentum. 

Management says two-thirds of B2C volume is now direct, improving marketing efficiency. The street is re-rating the story as “new management, new playbook.”

Affirm $AFRM is trading up over 10% after a strong quarter. Revenue up 34% y/y to $933M and GMV up 42% to $10.8B

The Card business is the standout again, with GMV up 135% and active cardholders now 2.8M. Active consumers grew 24% to 24.1M.

Levchin called it their “highest-ever GMV in a quarter with few shopping holidays,” which helped ease concerns around credit and discretionary spend softness

Wendy's $WEN is up this morning after Q3 came in better than feared. Same-store sales fell 3.7% but that’s less of a drop than expected, and the company held its full-year outlook after cutting it earlier. 

International sales were up 3% and the value-focused menu is clearly resonating as consumers trade down. Fast food is holding up while fast-casual chains feel more pressure.

Sweetgreen $SG trading lower after another weak quarter. Comps were down 9.5% as foot traffic slid, and trends worsened through August and September before stabilizing at a low double-digit decline in October. 

Guidance now implies an 11%–14% comp drop in Q4. Sweetgreen is seeing a notable pullback from 25–35 year olds, which is ~30% of its base, making the timing of a turnaround hard to call.

Nvidia $NVDA CEO Jensen Huang was asked about a recent story that said he warned that China will beat the US in the AI race

“That’s not what I said. What I said was China has very good AI technology. They have many AI researchers, in fact 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China. And they develop very good AI technology. In fact, the most popular AI models in the world today, open-source models, are from China. So, they are moving very, very fast. The United States has to continue to move incredibly fast. And otherwise, otherwise – the world is very competitive, so we have to run fast.” (H/T [@​dnystedt](<https://twitter.com/dnystedt>))

FIRST BRANDS BANKRUPTCY UPDATE:

Judge approved access to the final $600M in emergency financing, preventing an immediate shutdown of the auto-parts supplier. The funding completes a $1.1B package, but comes with a major roll-up that moves $3.3B of existing debt to the front of the line.

Company had warned it would have to liquidate without the cash. This follows the lawsuit alleging founder Patrick James siphoned ~$700M, which he denies.

TREASURY PROBES $9B SMALL-BUSINESS CONTRACTS

The Treasury Dept is investigating whether companies abused the SBA 8(a) program by using small firms as pass-throughs to access set-aside federal contracts. 

Officials say the program is meant to help genuinely disadvantaged small businesses, not larger firms routing work through them. ATI Government Solutions was recently suspended and denies wrongdoing.

BREAKING: Democrats are getting ready to offer reopening the government if health care subsidies are extended to one year.

Some House Republicans have agreed with this proposal, but now it depends on Senate Republicans to get on board with this. 

Markets are trying to flip green on the idea of the shutdown possibly ending by this weekend.

Samsung is in advanced talks with Barclays to launch a U.S. credit card, aiming to build a financial ecosystem similar to $AAPL Apple’s, per WSJ. 

The card would tie into Samsung’s wallet and could be paired with savings and BNPL products. 

Barclays gets access to Samsung’s 70M+ U.S. mobile users as it pushes deeper into co-brand cards.

Real-estate giant Blackstone is liquidating a major investment gone wrong:

A $1.8 billion wager on senior housing that has saddled the firm with more than $600 million in losses.

It is shaping up to be one of the New York firm’s worst investments in recent years.

Blackstone has been quietly selling off its portfolio of about 9,000 senior-housing units across the U.S. through a series of one-off transactions, sometimes at losses of more than 70% compared with their purchase price

Overall, a Journal analysis of 39 of Blackstone’s senior-housing properties found that the firm paid more than $755 million for them. Between 2022 and 2025, the firm sold or is in contract to sell those properties for about $536 million, about 29% less than the purchase price.

Visa $V and Mastercard $MA are nearing a settlement with merchants that aims to end a 20-year-old legal dispute by lowering fees stores pay and giving them more power to reject certain credit cards

Under terms being discussed, Visa and Mastercard would lower credit-card interchange fees, which are often between 2% and 2.5%, by an average of around 0.1% over several years

They would also loosen rules that require merchants that accept one of a network’s credit cards to accept all of them. For example, some stores might turn away rewards cards, which charge them higher fees and in recent years have become very popular with consumers

A deal could be announced soon and would require court approval to take effect

$NVDA has asked TSMC to boost 3nm wafer output for Blackwell by up to 50%, pushing capacity from roughly 100k–110k wafers a month toward ~160k, according to local reports. That’s an extra ~35k wafers monthly tied to Blackwell chips. 

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand is strengthening “month by month,” and that all three HBM suppliers have already scaled capacity to support the ramp.

🇺🇸 Senators have reportedly reached a deal to end the government shutdown

The Senate is poised to vote later tonight night to advance the House-passed stopgap, which will later become the vehicle for the larger funding deal.

The government-opening agreement also guarantees that federal employees laid off during the shutdown are re-hired and gives federal employees backpay

That vote would tee up consideration later this week of a legislative package that would fund the Department of Agriculture and the FDA, the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction projects, and the operations of Congress, for the full fiscal year ... All other agencies would be funded through Jan. 30th

Jeff Bezos was asked why space exploration is important to him  https://x.com/BourbonCap/status/1987569978728382464/video/1

“Ultimately if we want to keep growing our civilization and using more energy per person and so on and so on, we’re eventually going to have to move all of our heavy industry off Earth

And that will happen. I know it sounds a little fantastical. Maybe it sounds like science fiction to some degree, but it will happen. I don’t know how soon it will happen

It’s a job that I won’t finish, probably my children’s children won’t finish. This is something that multiple generations will work on, but it will happen."

The Senate just passed the first step of a deal to end the U.S. government shutdown. The procedural vote cleared with exactly 60 yes votes after Sen. John Cornyn flew in late to cast the final one. 

The plan funds the government through January and guarantees a December vote on extending ACA subsidies. The shutdown won’t officially end until the House approves it and President Trump signs it

📢 𝐉𝐔𝐒𝐓 𝐈𝐍: WISeKey and Columbus Acquisition execute merger for WISeSat spin-off - $WKEY $LAES $WHIN 

Under the agreement, WISeKey will receive 25 million shares in the new public company at $10 per share, representing $250 million in equity value. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with WISeKey retaining majority ownership of the combined entity.

WISeSat operates a constellation of nanosatellites designed to provide secure Internet of Things connectivity. The company has launched 22 satellites with 14 currently operational as part of its Low Earth Orbit constellation. WISeSat plans to deploy 100 satellites by 2030 to serve industries including agriculture, logistics, defense, and environmental monitoring.

The satellites incorporate post-quantum cryptographic chips from SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES), another WISeKey subsidiary, along with encryption and authentication systems. WISeSat plans to launch its next-generation post-quantum-secure satellite aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in November 2025.

WISeKey and SEALSQ are expected to invest at least $10 million in cash to WISeSat in connection with the business combination. The agreement allows WISeKey to distribute up to 10% of its received shares to its shareholders immediately after closing.

We have a clear growth path ahead with (i) an elevated pricing floor support from the government of $110/kg; (ii) volumes growth through heavy refining, magnet and recycling, placing MP in a strategic and unique position. We believe we could see further upside in numbers in the coming quarters, depending on refinery progress and whether a mine plan optimization could come into play at Mountain Pass, although we believe those would be medium- to long-term added opportunities."

China has suspended its ban on exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the U.S., per Reuters. 

The suspension runs through Nov. 2026, but the metals still fall under China’s broader export controls, meaning shippers must get licenses from Beijing.

Morgan Stanley Downgrades $JD to Underweight from Equalweight, PT $28

Analyst comments: "JD had benefited the most (vs. other e-Commerce platforms like Alibaba and PDD) from trade-in policy since late August 2024 because its GMV/sales exposure to home appliances and electronics was the highest. However, the effects of trade-in policy are tapering and the benefits are turning into a high base from 3Q25. We expect JDR's revenue growth to slow down to 5.6% YoY in 4Q25 with potential YoY declines in home appliance and electronics sales. Looking into 2026, we expect JDR's revenue growth to slow further, to 4.4% YoY.

We expect the tapering trade-in effects and hence slower revenue growth to lead to less operating leverage for JD over the next 12 months. In addition, JD's incessant investments in new businesses are likely to drag down its long-term margins and ROE. We expect JD's non-GAAP net margin to decline to ~2.3-2.5% in 2025-30 and project structural deterioration in its ROE from 20.3% in 2024 to 12.6% in 2030."

Raymond James Upgrades $VSAT to Outperform from Market Perform, PT $52

Analyst comments: "We upgrade VSAT to Outperform with a $52 price target after F2Q26 results. We believe, despite very strong stock performance over the past ~6 months (after a rough few years since our downgrade in 11/2022), there remains substantial sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) upside plus several catalysts. Investors are starting to recognize the significant value of the Defense & Advanced Technologies (DAT) business as VSAT’s strategic review for a possible spin-out continues, with comps trading in the 20s to 40s+ EV/EBITDA vs. Satellite businesses typically in the single digits, and a spin could better realize the valuation gap. Moreover, the very important Viasat-3 (VS-3) F2 and F3 launches are imminent, and while VSAT’s last couple of launches have had minor to major issues, we think the current valuation accounts for launch/in-service risk. These launch risks, along with SpaceX Starlink competition, uncertainty on the strategic review outcome and timing, and minor government shutdown risks, keep us from going to Strong Buy, but we think the risk/rewards are quite compelling."

Goldman Sachs Maintains Buy on $DKNG, Lowers PT to $54 from $59

Analyst comments: "Coming out of Draftkings Q3’25 earnings, we'd highlight a few themes: 1) while Q3 revenue of $1.14bn and Adj. EBITDA of $(126)m were both below GSe/Street and company guidance for the quarter on the back of customer-friendly sports outcomes in September, underlying growth was healthy with NFL handle up +13% and NBA handle up +19% year-over-year in the season to date; 2) the company signaled an upcoming push into prediction markets with DraftKings Predictions (including sports event contracts); 3) FY25 EBITDA guidance was lowered due to a combination of customer-friendly sports outcomes in September/October and prediction markets launch costs, with FY26 also now likely to be impacted by investments related to prediction markets and the new ESPN partnerships (with ROI on these buckets of spend still TBD); 4) core value drivers continued improving; and 5) enhanced capital returns as the company authorized a doubling of the share repurchase program. We maintain our Buy rating but lower our 12-month PT to $54 (from $59) as we adjust our forward estimates for this earnings report and management's updated forward commentary."

We can’t ignore the 1970s or the post-pandemic inflation run-up, but we can’t ignore the rest of history either. We don’t want to work so hard to not be the 1970s that we cut off the possibility of the 1990s, losing jobs & growth in the process. That would be trading one mistake for another.

Robinhood $HOOD is working on a way for everyday investors to get exposure to private AI startups, per FT.

The plan is to offer a tradeable fund run by Robinhood Ventures that would hold a small group of “best-in-class” private AI companies, and could use leverage.

This would let retail investors invest in names that have mostly been limited to VCs and institutions, but the fund would be closed-end, meaning money could be locked up and losses could go to zero.

Needham on $DKNG (Buy, PT $52): The most important take away from earnings is Draftkings will be launching prediction markets with sports, implying they will effectively have a nationwide sports betting product. It would be better if this outcome happened through OSB regulation than prediction markets. 

But the baseline for our model is no additional state launches after MO, therefore we think our medium term EBITDA should be higher now with prediction markets than without it. There is a cost of this added TAM and we are taking down our adj. EBITDA estimates to ~ $1B for '26E, although assume this is a one-year investment cycle and leave our '27E estimates unchanged."

Priority Technology $PRTH received a non-binding buyout proposal from CEO/Chairman Thomas Priore to take the company private at $6.00–$6.15/share in cash, per a Schedule 13D filing.

Priore and his investor group already control ~60% of shares. The offer values PRTH around $510M–$520M in equity and would be funded with a mix of equity + new debt, with no financing contingency.

A special committee of independent directors will need to evaluate the proposal, and there’s no guarantee a deal is finalized.

UBS SAYS S&P 500 COULD HIT 7,500 IN 2026

UBS is forecasting the S&P 500 to reach 7,500 next year, driven by ~14% earnings growth, with nearly half of that coming from tech. 

They see a “soft patch” in the near term as tariffs work through the economy, but expect growth to pick up later in 2026 as confidence and fiscal support improve.

UBS expects gains to come mainly from earnings, not higher valuations, and thinks the rally could broaden beyond mega-cap tech by mid-2026. 

They still see the U.S. outperforming Europe and EM, and prefer equities over credit heading into next year.

$BMNR $ETH

Bitmine acquires 110,228 ETH over the past week, now owning 2.9% of the entire Ethereum supply. 

Tom Lee: "The recent dip in ETH prices presented an attractive opportunity and BitMine increased its ETH purchases this week."

"To me, it is evident that Wall Street is very interested in tokenizing assets onto the blockchain, creating greater transparency and unlocking new value for issuers and investors. This is the key fundamental story and supports our view that Ethereum is a super cycle story over the next decade."

$COIN IS LAUNCHING A NEW TOKEN SALES PLATFORM

Coinbase will now let retail investors buy tokens before they list, hosting about one sale per month and allocating purchases via an algorithm during a one-week window. Buyers will use USDC, and projects must meet Coinbase vetting criteria. Monad will be the first token offered next week. 

To avoid 2017-style “dump and run,” early sellers get reduced future allocations, and project teams can’t sell for 6 months.

Papa John’s $PZZA is reportedly close to a $65/share take-private deal with TriArtisan Capital (per ABC). That would value the company at roughly $2.7B, a ~58% premium to Friday’s close. 

TriArtisan recently agreed to buy Denny’s and already owns P.F. Chang’s and Hooters. Talks still ongoing, no final agreement yet.

The EU is preparing a “digital omnibus” proposal that would simplify GDPR and parts of the AI Act to make it easier for companies to train AI models on EU user data, including some sensitive categories for bias detection. 

The draft also narrows what counts as “personal data” and gives existing generative AI products a one-year grace period to add watermarking. .

Warren Buffett posted his annual Thanksgiving letter. 

He said to stop writing Berkshire’s annual report and is “going quiet” as Greg Abel becomes CEO at year end. 

He has converted 1,800 A shares into 2.7M B and donated about $1.1B to four family foundations. 

He will keep a significant amount of A shares until shareholders gain comfort with Abel. 

He says the gift acceleration does not change his Berkshire outlook. 

“Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money… Kindness is costless but also priceless.”

He will continue to write thanksgiving letter.

WARREN BUFFETT JUST SENT WHAT COULD BE HIS LAST MESSAGE TO BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY $BRK.B SHAREHOLDERS AS CEO OF THE COMPANY

Here is the full and entire 8 page press release Warren Buffett just released ⬇️⬇️

To My Fellow Shareholders:  

I will no longer be writing Berkshire’s annual report or talking endlessly at the annual meeting. As the British would say, I’m “going quiet.” 

Sort of. 

Greg Abel will become the boss at yearend. He is a great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator. Wish him an extended tenure. 

I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message. Berkshire’s individual shareholders are a very special group who are unusually generous in sharing their gains with others less fortunate. I enjoy the chance to keep in touch with you. Indulge me this year as I first reminisce a bit. After that, I will discuss the plans for distribution of my Berkshire shares. Finally, I will offer a few business and personal observations. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * 

As Thanksgiving approaches, I’m grateful and surprised by my luck in being alive at 95. When I was young, this outcome did not look like a good bet. Early on, I nearly died.  

It was 1938 and Omaha hospitals were then thought of by its citizens as either Catholic or Protestant, a classification that seemed natural at the time.  

Our family doctor, Harley Hotz, was a friendly Catholic who made house calls toting a black bag. Dr. Hotz called me Skipper and never charged much for his visits. When I experienced a bad bellyache in 1938, Dr. Hotz came by and, after probing a bit, told me I would be OK in the morning.   

He then went home, had dinner and played a little bridge. Dr. Hotz couldn’t, however, get my somewhat peculiar symptoms out of his mind and later that night he dispatched me to St. Catherine’s Hospital for an emergency appendectomy. During the next three weeks, I felt like I was in a nunnery, and began enjoying my new “podium.” I liked to talk – yes, even then – and the nuns embraced me. 

To top things off, Miss Madsen, my third-grade teacher, told my 30 classmates to each write me a letter. I probably threw away the letters from the boys but read and reread those from the girls; hospitalization had its rewards.  

The highlight of my recovery – which actually was dicey for much of the first week – was a gift from my wonderful Aunt Edie. She brought me a very professional-looking fingerprinting set, and I promptly fingerprinted all of my attending nuns. (I was probably the first Protestant kid they had seen at St. Catherine’s and they didn’t know what to expect.) 

My theory – totally nutty, of course – was that someday a nun would go bad and the FBI would find that they had neglected to fingerprint nuns. The FBI and its director, J. Edgar Hoover, had become revered by Americans in the 1930s, and I envisioned Mr. Hoover, himself, coming to Omaha to inspect my invaluable collection. I further fantasized that J. Edgar and I would quickly identify and apprehend the wayward nun. National fame seemed certain. 

Obviously, my fantasy never materialized. But, ironically, some years later it became clear that I should have fingerprinted J. Edgar himself as he became disgraced for misusing his post.  

Well, that was Omaha in the 1930s, when a sled, a bicycle, a baseball glove and an electric train were coveted by me and my friends. Let’s look at a few other kids from that era, who grew up very nearby and greatly influenced my life but of whom I was for long unaware. 

I’ll begin with Charlie Munger, my best pal for 64 years. In the 1930s, Charlie lived a block away from the house I have owned and occupied since 1958. 

Early on, I missed befriending Charlie by a whisker. Charlie, 6 ⅔ years older than I, worked in the summer of 1940 at my grandfather’s grocery store, earning $2 for a 10-hour day. (Thrift runs deep in Buffett blood.) The following year I …

so…how are we feeling about this bifurcated economy argument that we’ve all heard over the past year? 

stocks up, asset holders can continue to spend and subsidize the economy

ai capex up, the hyperscalers continue to keep the ai trade alive

on the other end…

low end consumer spending down, as seen via major consumer brands like $CMG and $LULU getting hit

subprime auto defaults hitting record highs, credit card debt continuing to climb at an aggressive pace

grocery / electricity prices continue to climb…ironically the ai capex trade is what could be causing electricity to be going up

do we think the Fed cutting rates can fix this? are layoffs only going to intensify because of AI which would be deflationary but hurt earnings?

many questions as we prepare for next year…curious to hear an anecdotal experiences on how folks are thinking of the broader economy

JPMorgan says the next five years could require $5T to $7T in total investment. About $1.5T may come from investment-grade bonds, plus $150B from leveraged finance and up to $40B a year in data-center securitizations. 

Even then, there’s still roughly a $1.4T funding gap likely filled by private credit and governments.

Tom Lee on Palantir's valuation:  

"I think Palantir is an example of what they call an n=1 business developing products that really seem like magic for the companies that use them. Palantir is opening up so many markets that if they were a venture capital firm they'd be getting carry for how they transform businesses. To me, I think this is still a market discovering how to define the valuation model for Palantir but that doesn't mean its a bubble, people would've said that about Tesla in 2018 since it looked incredibly expensive and Tesla has been a huge performer since then."

$NVDA best day since April

S&P less than 1% from ATHs 

so last week was just the market scared of the shutdown and crypto de-leveraging?

if so…the next major catalyst is Nvidia earnings and based on what we heard at GTC, we know that’s going to be strong

with gov reopening, we’ll start getting more macro data next week

most of that data likely signaling a rate cut is needed in December

definitely cracks in various places, especially as more debt is used to finance AI, but overall story for the markets seem intact

Elon Musk has officially been issued the shares from $TSLA 2025 CEO Performance Award, per a new SEC filing. The 423.7M shares are split into 12 tranches and held in his revocable trust. 

He cannot vote them directly right now due to an irrevocable proxy. Each tranche only vests if Tesla meets strict performance milestones, with vesting dates in 2033 or 2035 depending on when those targets are hit.

$HIMS Institutional onwership is now 105.62% 🤣🤣

[@​wearehims](<https://twitter.com/wearehims>)  Short sellers are shorting the stock so much that now Institutional ownerships passed 105%

The reason:Institutions that are shorting the stock (betting on a price decline) must borrow shares from long holders to sell. This creates "overlapped" or "double-counted" shares in the total long reported shares. Short sellers report their shorts separately (, via 13F short disclosures), but the ownership percentage typically focuses on longs, inflating the total beyond the actual float (publicly available shares).

Total shares outstanding are approximately 219.7 million (inferred from the data: 231.6M long shares ÷ 105.62% ≈ 219.2M, aligning with recent reports). The excess (5.62%) stems from these overlaps, not errors. High short interest amplifies this HIMS has had notable short activity in the past, though exact current short interest isn't detailed on the page.

This is common for high short interest stocks.

Anthropic projects it will break even in 2027 and reach around $70B in revenue and $17B in cash flow by 2028, with most growth coming from enterprise usage of Claude.

That puts Anthropic on track to become profitable earlier than OpenAI’s projected 2029 timeline.

SoftBank has sold its entire Nvidia stake for about $5.83B

SoftBank says the sale helps fund over $30B of new investments and was “nothing to do with $NVDA itself,” calling it routine portfolio rotation.

SOFTBANK COMMENTS ON AI BUBBLE:

“I don't think I can answer whether this is bubble or not... we will be able to tell later... this is... just the beginning... there are lots of movement, which is... a good thing."

“Right now... many services and products will be developed in AI era... how you value that is very important but also difficult... the market try to obtain that in advance... sometimes... you are too too much in advance so that you try to withdraw a little bit.”

“For example, back in year 2000, so-called internet bubble... was that really the bubble... was not... was actually... valued after the bubble finished.”

UBS Upgrades $LIN to Buy from Neutral, Lowers PT to $500 from $507

Analyst comments:
"We upgrade Linde to Buy as we believe the stock is at an attractive 2.5x up/downside skew, and we think an acceleration in EPS growth in 2026 will be a positive catalyst. LIN is currently trading at ~10% discount to average, consistent with where the stock has been when investors have shown lower confidence in growth. We think there are factors in 2025, that will not repeat in 2026, that will raise adj EPS growth from ~6% to ~9-10% YY. Then more backlog start-ups over 2026-27 helps by another 1-2%. There has also been more debate on the ability to maintain higher pricing, but we don't see that decelerating medium term. Overall we model adj EPS growth of ~9% in 2026 with no macro growth, and see adj EPS accelerating to ~11% CAGR in our medium term forecast. We think the stock is pricing in closer to a ~7% CAGR using our reverse DCF."

Morgan Stanley on $CRWV (EW, $99 PT):

"Bottom line, accruing and expanding large contracts from the most demanding GenAI users provide strong validation of CoreWeave's strong positioning for the ramping GPU build-out, but consistent execution to provisioning and the operating of that GPU infrastructure – even in a constrained environment – will be key to proving durability in the story." 

"Being the premier provider of GPU clusters in an environment of swiftly ramping demand for GPU capacity is an unequivocal positive, and the company is making significant strides in diversifying the customer base – with the Nvidia and Meta deal, now no customer represents >35% of revenue backlog." 

"However, the degree of difficulty in the high-wire act CoreWeave is performing has always been high, and likely getting higher in this environment. While we remain on the sidelines awaiting further evidence of the broadening of the software story at CoreWeave, for investors with strong conviction in the build-out of the GPU economy and longer-term investment horizons, a pullback in CRWV, better balancing the risk/reward, could be looked at as an interesting entry point."

BTIG Raises $REAL PT to $15 from $11 - Buy

Analyst comments:
"REAL delivered resounding 3Q25 results, hitting the 20% growth barrier in a tough consumer environment. In the process, REAL delivered the largest GMV beat since the pandemic and, unlike back then, growth is coming at positive incremental EBITDA margins, highlighting the stark improvement in the business model in the past year from the leadership of the current management team.

Underlying KPIs also impressed with active buyers increasing by 23K q/q, the largest sequential increase since 4Q22. AOV increased 12% y/y, with both units and ASP contributing about equally to the increase. AOV growth accelerated sequentially compared to 8% y/y growth in 2Q25. Orders rose 7% y/y, 50 bps faster than buyer growth, leading to a modest improvement in orders per buyer. However, at 0.8 orders per buyer in the quarter, this metric is still 22% below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting there's significant future potential as newer cohorts mature (improved macro conditions wouldn't hurt either).

On the supply side, REAL's initiatives are also bearing fruit as supply value per luxury consultant rose 12% y/y. On the back of these strong results we are raising our PT on REAL shares to $15 from $11. In addition to being ideally positioned for the current environment and the aforementioned opportunity to grow orders/buyer, we see future catalysts including: 1) buying back the relatively expensive 13.00% 2031 Notes which become redeemable at par starting in October 2026; 2) further adoption of Athena which we expect to deliver $15MM+ in cost savings at full implementation; and 3) long-term opportunity to hit 40%+ incremental EBITDA margins through a combination of operating leverage opportunities, tariff-related pricing gains, and product mix.

This would drive meaningful upside to the low-30s incremental margins we are modeling through 2027. Our PT implies 3x 2027E sales and 4x 2027E gross profit, both in line with resale peer ThredUp (TDUP, Not Rated), which is more than justified in our view given REAL is growing ~200 bps faster than TDUP in terms of revenue with triple the EBITDA margins (based on each company's respective 4Q25 guidance). Maintain BUY."

JPMorgan Downgrades $CRWV to Neutral from Overweight, Lowers PT to $110 from $135

Analyst comments:
"We continue to see tremendous long-term opportunity for CoreWeave to serve the AI mega-trend and appreciate the accolades it has achieved with momentum it is carrying through the combination of large slugs of business and a growing list of customers. More tactically, in our view, its FQ3 (September) results include both positive and negative developments, while the interpretation of the net takeaway may skew slightly in either direction, depending on investors’ relative focus on bookings versus revenue timing.

On the positive side of the ledger: revenue backlog nearly doubles sequentially and crosses well into the $50B range; the composition of the revenue backlog shows better diversification among the largest constituents; the company is adding customers such as CrowdStrike, Poolside, Rakuten, and Jasper to its roster; and the sovereign opportunity is becoming more visible with the launch of CoreWeave Federal and the addition of customers such as NASA and the UK government.

On the negative side: the new variable is supply chain pressures escalating to a point that they are impacting one specific third-party data center developer used by CoreWeave, which is running behind schedule and shifts some of CoreWeave’s revenue out of Q4. This means that not only are the major hyperscalers being forced to issue capacity-constrained revenue guidance, but the phenomenon is also spreading to CoreWeave, which has historically set one of the highest bars for orchestration and delivery timelines in deployment of modern AI data centers."

Cantor Fitzgerald Raises $RKLB PT to $72 from $54 - OW 

Analyst comments:
"In our view, Rocket lab Neutron launch vehicle (once operational) will be the only current viable alternative to the Falcon 9, and will provide customers an opportunity to diversify away from SpaceX. In conclusion, we continue to view Rocket Lab's track record of successful space launches (heritage is a key differentiator), the portfolio of three different rocket types (small, hypersonic and medium launch), the customer type diversification (Commercial and Government / domestic and international), and the dedicated launchpads in New Zealand and the U.S., as material moats, and we remain bullish ahead of key material catalysts. We Reiterate our OW Rating and Increase our PT to $72 (from prior $54)."

officially bought $NBIS this morning on the dip

trading at 3x 2026 ARR based on new guidance 

have not been early to the story but given the updated valuation on that type of growth…hard to ignore it

they also won their second hyperscaler deal which was important for me to see the ability for them to win multiple of these deals

quite frankly, I also just really, really like management and feel I can trust them

i did a deepdive on my substack for Nebius when it was trading at $130 and was waiting for an opportunity…officially in!

A BIG DATA CENTER PLANNED IN SOUTH KOREA COULD BE BUILT AND RUN BY AI

A $35 billion facility under development in South Korea 🇰🇷 could be the world’s first large-scale data center designed, built and run by artificial intelligence.

The investor group behind the project, Stock Farm Road, has partnered with AI developer Voltai to make AI the architect, manager and operator of the South Korea-based data center. 

Under the partnership, dubbed “Project Concord,” AI will take charge of the data center’s design, construction and operation, from efficiently managing the use of resources like power and water to adapting quickly to different AI computing workloads. 

Humans will be involved, but only as supervisors, with AI acting as the decision-maker, the firms said.

They removed 6 paid holidays for full-time hourly store workers, meaning days like Thanksgiving & Christmas are no longer paid unless you work the shift

Some employees estimate losing around $1K a year from the change

$GRAB

Very important updates over the past few days:

If you've been following the Grab-GoTo saga, earlier in the year many reports claimed that Grab would be making a bid for GoTo, their largest competitor in Indonesia. After a few months, those rumors died out.

Over the past week, state officials from the Indonesian President's office explicitly said they are looking for a way to merge Grab and GoTo as they believe the level of employment is critical to the region. 

The biggest issue has been a price war leading to good prices for consumers but bad margins for shareholders and bad wage for drivers. If you were to merge both, those issues would be resolved and you'd have much more stability.

This also comes after a horrific GoTo scandal where executives were syphoning money away from the state and putting in their pockets when it was supposed to go to under-served children in the region. This brand damage has not gone well with people in the region and regulators have also been very upset about this.

Well, late last night, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank (which owns a decent chunk of Grab and GoTo) is looking to potentially oust the GoTo CEO in order to clear the way for...a Grab takeover. 

"Several GoTo shareholders signed a memo to the board requesting an extraordinary general meeting, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the move isn’t public. The backers, which include some of GoTo’s co-founders, are proposing a vote on matters including replacing the CEO, who oversaw a more than 40% decline in GoTo’s market value over his tenure. Walujo is also perceived as opposing a takeover by Grab, the people said."

Basically, the CEO doesn't want a merger but isn't delivering shareholder returns. Grab has begun to really show growth in the region and their stock is up 35% over the past year, GoTo is down 1% over the same time. Softbank would likely want to consolidate their stakes so that there is one winner vs having two fight to win. The company in the better financial position is obviously Grab and actually has the cash (5.3B) to execute a merger, not sure what the price would be.

There is now an extraodinary general meeting for GoTo on December 17th. 

If this were to happen, it likely would be the ride-hailing/mobility part of GoTo merging and not the financial arm, but it would be absolutely massive.

My thesis on $GRAB has been that the regional players are consolidating and I feel Grab will be one of a few winners, getting access to everything GoTo has built an integrating it into their ecosystem could dramatically increase growth estimates and truly establish them as the dominant player. Smart money might also know this which is why 85% of the gloat is now owned by tutes.

Exciting story to cover as we head into 2026!

The U.S. imported about $750M worth of pasta from Italy 🇮🇹 last year, far more than from anywhere else

Now that the U.S. is weighing tariffs of around 107% on Italian pasta, prices in U.S. stores could double, and some brands may withdraw from the market as soon as January.

Morgan Stanley Upgrades $RXO to Overweight from Equalweight, PT $19 

Analyst comments: "We are upgrading RXO from EW to OW. Our PT remains $19, which implies ~65% upside to their stock price after the ~35% selloff post-earnings last week. The 4Q guide was undoubtedly disappointing pointing to near breakeven EPS, but 4Q guides have been weak across the space (average 11.5% downgrade) reflecting tough demand conditions to end the year. However, we remain confident that normalized EPS over time is at least $1 here, implying a ~$18–20 fair value at an 18–20x normalized PE multiple. The fact that RXO was an $18+ stock three weeks ago is a sign that once the Street is convinced that we are seeing some signs of market improvement, the stock should snap back as well, even if the post-Coyote $30+ highs will need evidence of $1.50+ normalized EPS over time. We also believe that RXO can be amongst the leaders in the deployment of AI in the brokerage space and that this will not be a winner-take-all space as the market is currently pricing into brokerage stocks (especially CHRW)."

Analyst: Ravi Shanker

UBS ran the math on the floated 50-year mortgage idea. On a median ~$420K home, it could lower monthly payments by about $119 (or boost bp by $23K)

But stretching the loan from 30-50 Yrs would roughly double the total interest paid & slow down how quickly homeowners build equity

The probe was escalated to the FHFA Inspector General, who then sent the findings to federal prosecutors in Virginia. The matter comes as James faces a separate mortgage fraud case she has called politically motivated.

$FRMI'S $30B TEXAS AI CAMPUS HITS DELAY

Fermi’s 11-gigawatt “Project Matador” in Texas, described as the world’s largest AI energy and data center, is struggling to secure its first major tenant, according to Bloomberg. The Trump-linked company said the deal with an investment-grade client has been delayed by about 3 weeks, though the tenant has already advanced $150 million toward construction.

Despite the delay, Fermi says it is still on track to begin generating power next year and has secured key regulatory approvals, including NRC progress and permits for 6 gigawatts of gas-powered generation.

JPMorgan Initiates Coverage on $RACE with Overweight Rating

Analyst comments: "Reflecting on the key takeaways from the Capital Markets Day and 3Q results, we had the opportunity to gain additional insights from the CEO during the earnings call. For us, a few elements stand out when looking at Ferrari:

a) The business model is robust, and upcoming product launches will continue to provide opportunities to improve pricing and mix, as well as potentially achieve the 2030 targets earlier than planned, possibly one or two years earlier.

b) The firm is going through a profound change in the powertrain strategy, which may create some margin volatility in 2026 as it will incur launch costs and higher costs for the ramp-up of the paintshop and E facility.

c) From the CMD, we came out convinced the firm is launching the necessary transition into BEV at the right time and has done a solid job ensuring vertical integration in some of the E components to continue to excite Ferrari customers.

Having said this, we believe buy-side expectations may be too high. Based on our discussions, the market expects high single-digit revenue growth supported by a pricing strategy that may not necessarily need to be backed by increased value add or technology content, as well as flawless execution with EBIT margins consistently above 30%. On the back of a potentially higher fixed cost burden in the next two years, we trim our FY26/27 earnings estimates by 6% and see the firm generating solid 29% EBIT margins on average over the next two years."

Goldman Sachs Lowers $OKLO PT to $106 from $117 - Neutral

Analyst comments: "OKLO reported 3Q25 results that included higher-than-expected operating expenses, but management reiterated its 2025 guidance for cash used in operating activities of $65mn–$80mn. Importantly, the company’s cash position increased to $1.2bn due to raising $526mn in net proceeds under its ATM program as it pursues several initiatives, including advancing its first Aurora Powerhouse, establishing fuel capabilities, and supporting its Atomic Alchemy business. We note that OKLO shifted its expected timeline for filing a COLA with the NRC, but remains confident that the INL reactor will be operational in late 2027 or early 2028, with the potential for commercial operations through an NRC license still intact."

Raymond James Downgrades $BBWI to Market Perform from Outperform

Analyst comments: "While we believe there is low-hanging fruit to improve digital capabilities, product, and distribution, we expect this will take time to materialize, and until then, growth will remain below long-term potential. Our channel checks over the last two months suggest recent innovations have fallen short, while discounting in stores and online has increased (see table in note). We are lowering our estimates for both sales and EPS, and given our expectation for downward revisions to consensus, we believe risk/reward is now balanced even with shares trading at 8x EV/EBITDA and 10x P/E on CY26 estimates."

BofA Securities Lowers $OKLO PT to $111 from $117 - Neutral

Analyst comments: "We reiterate a Neutral rating following a constructive 3Q update that delivered meaningful progress on fuel de-risking and regulatory milestones, though key investor debates around FOAK capex (expected early ’26) and PPA timing remain unresolved. We maintain that Oklo’s vertically integrated model remains a key differentiator — execution continues to outpace peers, and DOE alignment adds credibility — but valuation already embeds a relatively smooth FOAK-to-NOAK trajectory.

Our price objective moves to $111 (from $117) on updated peer multiples and a higher share count following the $540M ATM. No major model changes are made pending greater visibility on capex, procurement scope, and PPA structure. The next catalysts will center on project cost definition, customer contracting, and financing mix. We reiterate a Neutral rating on balanced risk-reward."

Taiwan’s foreign minister said the government is “assessing” whether to use chip export controls as a diplomatic tool, though he added, “we hope not to have to use these measures.” 

The comment follows September’s brief move to restrict exports to South Africa, a step Taiwan quickly reversed. Officials now appear cautious about “weaponizing semiconductors,” mindful of the impact on major firms like TSMC.

Chevron $CVX expects EPS to grow more than 10% annually at $70 Brent, with $10B–$20B in annual buybacks planned through 2030. 

The company sees 2–3% yearly oil and gas output growth and cut its capex outlook to $18B–$21B a year. 

Chevron also plans its first AI data center power project in West Texas by 2027, saying it remains “stronger, more resilient, and better positioned than ever.”

UBS ON $AMD EVENT:

"AMD's new financial model delivered on the $20+ EPS bogey that we and many investors expected, and equally importantly the near-term commentary on data center GPU also generally supports our ~$10 EPS for C2027E. Customer commentary was also constructive with AMD again affirming that there will be multiple customers at a similar scale to OpenAI as soon as the MI450 generation in 2H26/1H27." 

"We do worry a bit that HBM supply could be a risk for AMD and now that this event is out of the way, the only remaining near-term catalyst is an announcement by Amazon at AWS re:Invent in early Dec. Broadly though, if the company does even a decent fraction of what is laid out today, the stock should keep moving higher over the next 12mos." 

"Net, our C2026/2027E EPS remains largely unchanged, but given the multi-year confidence, we are walking C2028E EPS higher (up to ~$14 from ~$12 prior). 

Our PT uses C2027E as a basis and remains $300, and we continue to rate AMD Buy as a rapidly rising tide should continue to lift this boat."

Here’s what analysts have to say after $AMD NY Event:

Melius (Buy; PT $380)
“We found the margin guide the real positive surprise... 35%+ revenue CAGR backs double-digit AI semi/networking share and ~$150B revenue by 2030. AMD seems to be targeting a $1T market cap with these aspirations. Execution and OpenAI funding are required, but a 10%+ AI share seems realistic. Raising estimates and PT to $380.”

Benchmark (Buy; PT $325)
“2025 Analyst Day doubled the AI Data Center TAM, laid out aggressive growth and margin targets, and showed roadmap traction... proof points: OpenAI 6GW, Oracle 50k MI450s, Meta co-defining Helios, DOE supercomputers, sovereign projects. Company on path to tens of billions in AI revenue in 2027 and >$100B Data Center revenue over next 3-5 years.”

Cantor Fitzgerald (Overweight; PT $350)
“Bullish target model: >35% revenue CAGR, 55-58% gross margin, >35% operating margin, ~25% FCF margin, EPS >$20. Implied CY29 mid-point revenue/EPS ~ $132B/$22+. Capital allocation centered on investing and M&A, repurchases $9.4B remaining, and maintaining investment grade credit.”

UBS (Buy; PT $300)
“New model delivered on $20+ EPS bogey and supports our ~$10 EPS for C2027E; C2028E EPS walked higher to ~$14. Customer commentary constructive; multiple customers at OpenAI scale expected with MI450. HBM supply is a watch item; AWS re:Invent could be a near-term catalyst.”

BofA (Buy; PT $300)
“Maintain Buy... AMD sees >$1T AI silicon TAM by CY30 and visibility into multi-gigawatt adoption beginning with MI450. Core business also expected >10% CAGR, combining with AI to yield up to $25–30+ CY30 EPS power. Risks: rack-scale execution, GM/opex prudence, networking gaps.”

Voice of skeptics:
“Bears note lack of new customer wins at the event... concerns that much of the strength is U.S.-centric and that the AI bubble could burst or that investors may rotate to NVDA. Some traders talking about short $AMD to buy $NVDA into prints.”

Evercore ISI (Outperform; PT $283)
“Skeptical OpenAI will fully ramp to 6GW but expect AMD solutions to ramp in volume. Increasing C27/C29 EPS estimates to $9.77/$14.64 and PT to $283 reflecting share gains and confidence in MI450 ramps.”

Jefferies (Buy; PT $300)
“Analyst Day struck a positive tone... 35%+ rev CAGR and 80%+ AI growth tied to MI400/MI500 adoption. Model implies $20+ EPS and potentially higher; near-term depends on market reception of MI400/MI500 series.”

Piper Sandler (Overweight; PT $280)
“Impressed by management’s line of sight to $20 EPS by 2030 and an 80%+ data center AI revenue CAGR over 3-5 years. Positive on Helios rack-level solution and AMD's near-complete stack (GPU, CPU, networking, DPU) being embedded in rack partners’ designs.”

Stifel (Buy; PT $280)
“Management updated silicon TAM to $1T by 2030... targets >60% CAGR for DC, >10% for Core, >35% aggregate next 3–5 years, and >$20 EPS longer term. Scenario analysis implies $13–$15 medium-term EPS power. We remain positive on AMD within AI TAM backdrop.”

Goldman Sachs (Neutral; PT $210)
“Expect stock to trade higher after upbeat targets... targets achievable but assume significant GM and OpEx leverage and hinge on a few key customers including OpenAI. Neutral given reliance on the OpenAI deal; constructive only with more confidence on that revenue stream.”

Mizuho (Neutral; PT $205)
“Q3 execution praise: +63% y/y revenue and big guide upside... but stock trades at ~64× 2027 revenue. Risk of multiple reversion even as fundamentals remain stellar. PLTR remains uniquely positioned for AI and digital modernization trends.”

Deutsche Bank (Hold; PT $250)
“Constructive AI/DC-driven meeting; TAM doubled to $1T and revenue CAGR target >35%. Company reiterated MI355 ramps and material 2H26 acceleration from wins including OpenAI and ORCL. Multiple multi-gigawatt customers expected over time.”

Bernstein (Market Perform; PT $200)
“Day went well; targets aggressive/…

$ONON earnings call was a blast. Here’s what mgmt. said:

“We’re going into this holiday season with a full price strategy. So we have no discounts coming up.”

“We are already seeing a strong order book for the new Cloud and Cloud Monster 3 launching in Q1, while fall winter 26 will see the launch of the new model, Cloud Max.”

“This quarter was a pivotal test of our premium strategy, as our US price increases came into effect. The results confirmed our view. Demand remained incredibly strong for our premium offerings. Clear validation of our brands, pricing power, and the impact of our full price strategy.”

“Omnichannel customers are more loyal and deliver materially higher lifetime value.”

“More and more AI becomes a core component to how we operate across all areas of the business.”

“If you look on the product side, you can expect a firework of innovation.”

“We have now really achieved a new level on gross profit margin that we also consider sustainable… we will digest our tariffs and still be well above our long term target.”

“If you’re going across a high school in the US, especially in a more affluent neighborhood, you’ll see the cool kids wearing Ons.”

The company said most of the data has nothing to do with the case and that releasing it would violate user privacy. 

The Times argues the logs are needed to determine whether ChatGPT reproduced its copyrighted material. OpenAI has until Friday to comply with the order

$NBIS $CRWV $IREN $ORCL

The street is obviously concerned about the datacenter trade.

What’s the easiest way to tell?

Oracle was at $230 before their monster Q2 with RPO +450%. They went to $350 in less than 24 hours.

The stock is now below $230. What changed?

They issued $40B of corporate bonds, some of those bonds that got downgraded, and basically told the street they don’t care about FCF because the ROI on capex growth matters more.

Now, I am actually happy to see $ORCL come back to reality. The move it made really was pure fomo, but if the street is scared about a psudeo-hyperscaler and their debit issuances, obviously they aren’t going to be happy with Nebius dilution, CoreWeave debt-equity ratio, or the unit economics on some of these BTC miners turned AI/HPC players. 

Is that full on bearish? No, but it is, in my opinion, VERY HEALTHY because many of those names are up 2-3x on the year, even with this recent drop!

I think you pick the best one and DCA, but you wait for core levels. I mean if Nebius gets back to $70…it’s almost like the entire $MSFT deal is erased. It’d be VERY attractive at those levels. I nibbled just now as a relatively new shareholder at $93.90 but I would be more interested if it really breaks down — which it may not, but the debt concerns seem to be the issue.

Exceptional execution, which many of those names have done, is what makes the dips buy-able if you believe in the broader macro AI datacenter trend as outlined by Lisa Su yesterday to further reinforce how large the market is becoming, but the debt concerns seem to be why these stocks are getting hit.

BOFA: 'WE SEE POTENTIAL FOR SPICES (E.G. VANILLA, CINNAMON) TO BE ANOTHER EXEMPTION'.

As it relates to tariff exemptions, Bessent mentioned that “you're going to see some substantial announcements over the next couple of days in terms of things we don't grow here in the United States, coffee being one of them, bananas, other fruits, things like that. So that will bring the prices down very quickly.” 

Companies within our coverage involved in cross-border sourcing for these types of raw materials include $KDP, $SJM, and $KHC for coffee, and $DOLE for bananas, and $COCO for other fruits (coconuts). 

This is not the first time the potential for tariff exemptions on internationally sourced raw materials has been discussed. In July, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also mentioned potential exemptions for the raw materials above as well as cocoa $HSY. We see potential for spices (e.g. vanilla, cinnamon) to be another exemption as a result $MKC."

SOME IMPORTANT MACRO STATS TO LOOK AT:

1. Bank of America says institutional clients were net buyers of U.S. equities last week, led by $4.3 billion in ETF inflows, largest since December 2022.

2. Hedgefunds and Retail were actually net sellers, institutional investors were net buyers. Outflows from Tech and inflows into Staples and Healthcare.

3. As per Bloomberg, ETF inflows continue to be strong, +13B yesterday alone, +40B for the past 5 days and now +1.16T YTD.

While there are plenty of concerns around inflation and the labor market, equity exposure continues to be strong even if there is a rotation into different sectors, which is actually very healthy to see to support the broadening of the market.

AI Bears are underestimating deflationary pressure in 2026 & beyond.

FFR may have to go to 1-2% in the next 12-16 months to balance it out.

I like how the market talks abt AI Bubble every week, this tames valuation for high conviction investors to buy cheaper. 

And that is exactly how we are going higher.

Not Financial Advice

President Trump signed the bill to end the 43-day shutdown, officially reopening the government.

Federal workers will get back pay, agencies will start clearing the backlog, and food assistance should come back online over the next week as states reload their systems. 

Key economic reports that were paused will get new release dates once agencies catch up. 

Important to note, Funding only runs through Jan 30, so there’s another shutdown fight coming unless Congress figures out a longer deal.

Japan’s 5-year yield is sitting near its highest level since 2008, and today’s auction showed a slight pullback in demand. The sale cleared at 100.22 with a 3.33 bid to cover versus 3.69 last month, as traders weigh when the BOJ will deliver its next rate hike.

Alibaba $BABA is planning a full revamp of its main mobile AI app, Bloomberg reports. The company will update its existing Tongyi apps and rebrand them as Qwen, then start adding agent style tools that can help users shop across Taobao and other services. 

The longer term goal is for Qwen to function as a full AI agent, with an overseas version planned later on. 

More than 100 developers are working on the project as Alibaba looks to match competitors like ByteDance and Tencent and eventually build a consumer revenue stream from AI.

The IEA has lifted its global oil demand outlook, but it still expects supply to pull ahead. 

The agency now sees demand rising 790k barrels a day in 2025 and 770k in 2026, both slightly higher than before. 

Yet supply is expected to grow even faster, with a projected surplus of about 4.09 million barrels a day in 2026, up from its earlier estimate of 3.97 million.

Goldman Sachs Maintains Buy on $ASND, PT $250

Analyst comments: "Yorvipath misses amidst heightened expectations; awaiting regulatory decisions on TransCon CNP, which could become the third leg of growth. ASND shares are under pressure (down -7% in the after-market) after the company reported its 3Q25 results with Yorvipath sales of €143mn coming in short of VA consensus estimates of about €149mn though largely in-line with GSe of $144mn. We view the slight miss as largely reflecting transient issues (namely inventory and FX) rather than changes in market demand or dynamics. On the forward, we think investors will monitor: 1) upcoming PDUFA for TransCon CNP in achondroplasia, 2) the cadence of the Yorvipath launch in both the US and EU, 3) 52-week data from the Phase 2 COACH TransCon CNP + GH combination study (early 2026), 4) competitor updates in achondroplasia and hypoparathyroidism, and 5) the company's transition to consistent operating income and positive earnings. Maintain Buy and our 12-month PT of $250."

Goldman Sachs Maintains Early-Stage Biotech Rating on $PRME

Analyst comments: "PRME hosted an investor event outlining its strategy in Wilson's disease, in the context of preclinical data of prime editor PM577 at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting (November 7–11) and the unmet need, with high rates of non-adherence to standard-of-care (30%–50% per the hosted KOL). PRME presented mouse model data, highlighting: (1) >80% correction of the H1069Q mutation with PM577 treatment, noting several prime editor candidates capable of >70% R778L correction (cumulative mutation prevalence of 50%); (2) restoration of copper homeostasis in the liver per copper PET imaging, returning to wild-type levels by week 8 following a single administration of PM577; and (3) no detectable off-target editing — identified by management as a key differentiator vs. other genome editing approaches. PRME remains on track to file the IND/CTA in Wilson's disease in 1H26, with H1069Q as the targeted mutation followed by R778L, and initiate a Ph1/2 study (data in 2027) assessing safety and PM577's ability to maintain copper balance post-discontinuation of standard-of-care. Overall, we view PRME's forward strategy as logical, leveraging the modularity of its platform and proprietary LNP to expand to other Wilson's mutations (potentially under the same IND) and liver indications (IND/CTA for PM647 in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency expected in mid-26)."

A WSJ investigation has found that about 2,300 $NVDA Blackwell chips ended up inside a Jakarta data center and are set to be used by a Shanghai AI startup, even with US export limits in place. 

The chips moved through a US-based server partner tied to Inspur, then to Indonesian telecom Indosat, which bought 32 GB200 racks for roughly $100 million after lining up the customer. 

WSJ says there’s no sign any laws were broken, but it shows how Chinese firms can still access Nvidia’s top hardware by renting compute outside China.

Memory chipmaker shares are under pressure after Japan’s Kioxia posted H1'25 revenue of ¥791B, down 13% YoY, with operating profit down 55% as higher NAND bit shipments could not offset weaker ASPs and a margin slide to 19% from 34%. 

Q2 revenue was ¥448B, bit shipments were up high 30s % QoQ, but ASP still ticked lower. Kioxia is guiding Q3 to record sales of ¥500–550B and higher profit, yet its 9 month outlook still has revenue 1% to 5% lower YoY and it passed on full year guidance, which is why the market read the print as underwhelming.

$NVDA is tightening its AI server supply chain for the Vera Rubin generation in 2H26, shifting to a model where Wistron, Quanta, and Foxconn build systems all the way to L10 and Nvidia handles the final rack stage and delivery. 

It’s a big change from the split vendor model and should cut variation across racks since Nvidia is now standardizing everything from assembly to cooling module procurement.

Novo Nordisk $NVO is hitting the euro bond market for about €3.5B to help fund its Akero deal, which could cost up to $5.2B as it pushes deeper into obesity linked liver disease treatments. 

The bonds run from 2 to 20 years, with the short end coming in around 45bps over Euribor and the long end marketed near 150 to 155bps over mid swaps. 

It’s another big M&A related debt sale in Europe this week, following L’Oreal’s €3B raise.

Tencent reported revenue of 192.9B yuan for the September quarter, up 15% with international gaming up 43% and net income up about 19%. 

Bloomberg Intelligence says earnings are tracking high-teen % growth this year, helped by AI in game design and ads, and the company is better positioned than e-commerce peers. Free cash flow is expected to grow 10-15% annually through 2025-28.

Rolls Royce reaffirmed its FY outlook as jet engine demand stays strong, led by Asia Pacific. It still expects £3.1B to £3.2B in operating profit and £3B to £3.1B in free cash flow despite supply chain pressures. A global engine shortage and longer maintenance cycles are supporting orders.

Wells Fargo Upgrades $NKE to Overweight from Equal Weight, Raises PT to $75 from $60; 'Visibility Now Improving, Lacing Up for Liftoff'

Analyst comments: "Raising Ests, Upside Scenarios Are Compelling. We raise our FY26 (above St) to $1.70 and FY27 to $2.40, but more notably, through a combo of our 1) Upside rev drivers (Classics stability + non-Classics biz growth) and 2) Ample GM recapture (ASPs + liquidation/reserve add backs) we show line of sight to Bull Case EPS Power of ~$2.00 and ~$3.00 over the same time periods. Said differently, NKE has been in a negative revision cycle for 3+ years, and we see that reversing over the next 6 to 9 months.

Why Upgrade Now? We believe for the first time in years a few things are happening: 1) Visibility is improving into NKE's revamped strategies (numbers bottoming), 2) Material green shoots are appearing (innovation) and 3) Headwinds to the biz are set to dissipate (Classics). We can finally begin to map out realistic return to growth forecasts, while sizable margin levers likewise take hold. Said differently, NKE has the potential to exit FY26 growing revs +3 to 4 percent with GMs expanding +200bps.

Classics Headwinds Have Peaked. We model Classics revs to decline to ~$9B in FY26 (from ~$11.5B in FY25). Classics headwind to rev peaked in 4Q (down >30 percent) and was likely down ~30 percent in 1Q. From here, 3 things inform our view that moderation is set to play out go forward: 1) industry checks confirm this view, 2) NKE commented they are seeing stabilization in AF1/AJ1, 3) historical sneaker search data tells us large franchise downtrends can last 40 to 70 months (with AF1/AJ1 currently at 63 and 54 months).

Non-Classics Back to Growth. A key today is the health of NKE's go forward business, and our math suggests that both footwear (ex Classics) and NKE's rest of biz accelerated meaningfully in 1Q. Non-Classics Footwear inflected to >20 percent while rest of biz was +MSD (led by apparel). While wholesale sell in surely accounts for a chunk of this growth, it is also clear that NKE's revamped silhouettes (Vomero and Peg) are driving greater volumes and should lend credibility to the turnaround efforts.

GM Visibility Is High. While GM remained in decline in 1Q, we see several key drivers which should lead to material GM recapture starting in 2H26. Namely, 1) NA liquidation laps, 2) improved ASPs/FP selling on Nike Direct and 3) potential recapture of reserves. These should all act as tailwinds to GM from 2H26 through FY27 (with a China GM recapture story looming in FY27).

Netting this all out, we see potential for NKE to drive upside to St GMs for the remainder of the FY in the 50 to 100bps range."

Apple and Tencent reached a deal that lets $AAPL process payments for WeChat mini games and apps in exchange for a 15% cut, half its usual in app fee. 

The agreement closes long standing payment workarounds and gives Apple a new revenue stream in a segment that drove 32.3B yuan in social network revenue for Tencent last quarter.

BofA Securities Upgrades $TT to Buy from Neutral, Raises PT to $550 from $490

Analyst comments: "We upgrade our rating on Trane Technologies (TT) to Buy from Neutral: (1) Trane has executed well through the resi slowdown in 2H25 and should get the potential upside in 2026; (2) Trane should benefit from Americas Transport recovery in 2026; (3) Trane benefits from strong exposure to applied HVAC, ~22% of revenue; (4) Trane’s growing service business dampens its cyclicality. We raise our PO by 12% to $550 still on 24x EV/EBITDA, but now based on 2027E from 2026E. We estimate that applied HVAC equipment represents ~22% of Trane’s revenue and services represent 1/3 of revenue. Trane’s applied business has remained strong, with CHVAC booking and sales up in all three regions in 3Q. Despite tough comps Trane’s Americas CHVAC business had orders up ~30%. For applied, Trane has seen particular strength in data centers as well as education, government, and health care. Trane expects strong execution and growth to continue in 2026. Despite potential cyclicality related to lumpiness of large orders and resi weakness, Trane has been able to consistently execute as the service business helps offset the cyclicality. With help from the service business Trane has outperformed its HVAC peers and Street expectations."

The cuts, the largest ever for the carrier, are set to take place in the next week. The majority of the reduction is expected to be made through layoffs

Verizon also plans to transition about 200 stores into franchised operations, which will shift employees off of its payroll.

Tesla is finally testing Apple CarPlay internally, per Bloomberg, after years of refusing to add it. 

A rollout is being discussed for the coming months, though plans aren’t final. 

$TSLA will use the standard wireless CarPlay version in a window inside its own UI, not the full Ultra setup, and it won’t integrate with FSD.

ugly day once again

there isn’t a massive headline but here’s what I think is causing it:

- market wanted CPI today, white house said “lol not gonna happen” so lack of data is causing issues

- Verizon just announced 15K layoffs, 15% of their workforce…markets seem to be thinking they can not ignore labor market even without data

- 3 different fed presidents all came out over the past 48 hours and said they are more concerned about inflation…Powell a few weeks ago made it clear he cares more about the downside risk to the labor market, so the sudden shift is now making people think a december cut wont happen

along with the potential fears on ai capex spend, that seems to be causing this drawdown

having said that…

- earnings are strong 

- tutes are buying heavily

- margins continue to increase

- datacenter buildout isnt going anywhere even if some debt is involved

- $AMD just guided for 35% rev growth next 5 years, $NVDA earnings next week

- rates eventually coming down and companies are still executing very well so money likely will be allocated as we prepare for cuts

- if the supreme court does reverse tariffs, could be bullish since markets never liked tariffs and could lower inflation expectations

not enough to go net bearish here and the lack of a real headline causing this pain means it might just be a headfake

Petrobras is considering a 5 year capex plan of about $106B for 2026 to 2030, down from the $111B in last year’s plan, as it shifts to Brent assumptions of roughly $60 to $65 instead of $83. 

Jefferies says a 5 to 10% pullback could keep annual dividends near $8B to $9B in a $60 to $70 oil world. Board signs off Nov 28.

To our adversaries, let this be an Omen.

Co-developed with [@​_edgegroup](<https://twitter.com/_edgegroup>), Omen is a hover-to-cruise AAV that achieves the endurance, speed, and payload of larger airplanes. All without a runway.

Omen takes off anywhere, recovers anywhere, and carries meaningful payload over the long ranges demanded by maritime operations.

Together, the parties will collaborate on Omen, a newly-developed hover-to-cruise Autonomous Air Vehicle (AAV) designed to pack the endurance, payload, and mission flexibility of much larger systems into a novel runway-independent group 3 airframe.

I was reading an FT piece on phantom data centers and utilities are finally cracking down. 

AEP Ohio has cut almost 30% of its queue and PG&E has dropped 400MW after realizing developers were pitching the same projects to multiple utilities. 

The chart shows how wide the 2030 energy forecasts swing from about 400TWh to over 1000TWh.

I was reading an FT piece about how “phantom” data centers are throwing US power planning completely off, and it’s honestly wild how big the disconnect has become. 

Developers are chasing the cheapest electricity, so they’re filing the same project with multiple utilities and then leaving those requests in the queue even after the plans are basically dead. 

That’s forcing utilities to clean house, AEP Ohio has already cut close to 30% of its pending projects and PG&E is trimming another 400MW, because they’re realizing the demand projections are being inflated by stuff that will never get built. 

And when you look at the chart, you see why they’re worried. Forecasts for 2030 data center electricity use are swinging from roughly 400TWh to over 1000TWh, which is the kind of spread that leads to overbuilt plants and higher rates for everyone. 

The whole system is trying to figure out what’s real and what isn’t.

I was reading an FT piece about how “phantom” data centers are skewing US power demand forecasts, and how the planning process is getting distorted.

Developers are chasing the cheapest electricity, so they’re filing the same project with multiple utilities and then leaving those requests in the queue long after they stop being viable

WSJ says Paramount $PARA, Comcast $CMCSA, and Netflix $NFLX are preparing first round nonbinding bids for Warner Bros. Discovery $WBD ahead of a Nov 20 deadline, with WBD aiming to finish the auction by year end. 

Paramount, backed by the Ellison family and RedBird, is still trying to buy the whole company after a prior $23.50 a share offer, while Comcast and Netflix are mainly interested in the Warner Bros. studio and Max streaming assets rather than the cable networks.

Applied Digital’s $APLD is trying to sell a $2.35B junk bond at about 97 cents on the dollar with a ~10% yield, per Bloomberg, which would be the second biggest discount for a US high yield deal this year. 

Order books were only around $2B as of yesterday, and some investors are seeing the deal as riskier than recent AI data center bonds since it leans heavily on speculative grade CoreWeave $CRWV as the main tenant.

Jefferies Upgrades $GAP to Buy from Hold, Raises PT to $30 from $22

Analyst comments: "The key takeaway is that we believe Gap has implemented fundamental changes that should drive improved near-term and long-term results. Year-over-year promotions are down and average selling prices are up at Gap. Old Navy and Gap rolling three-month web traffic turned positive quarter-over-quarter, with Old Navy foot traffic up 4%. Old Navy provides the strongest value, purchase consideration, and favorability in our group, while Banana Republic saw month-over-month improvement in purchase intent and favorability. We see an opportunity for Gap to reach $3.00 in earnings per share by fiscal year 2028. Our third-quarter earnings per share estimate is $0.62 versus the Street at $0.58."

Baird Upgrades $CRCL to Outperform from Neutral, PT $110

Analyst comments: "Circle underperformed the S&P by 63% since the June 30, 2025 close (CRCL -55%; S&P +9%) as the lock-up expiration approached (and occurred on November 13), post-IPO optimism faded, and concerns rose around falling rates and increasing distribution costs. We view valuation as reasonable (approximately 50x 2026E EPS) given strong USDC outstanding growth (Q3 +92% year over year; Q2 +86%), a sequential doubling of on-Circle USDC (from which Circle retains 100% of reserve income), accelerating wallet growth (+77% year over year), and strong interest in Arc/CPN testing (with about 100 partners onboarded and more than 500 in the pipeline)."

Stifel Downgrades $HD to Hold from Buy, Lowers PT to $370 from $440

Analyst comments: "We outline a cautious bias toward Home Depot and Lowe’s fiscal third-quarter 2025 earnings and are reducing our Home Depot rating to Hold from Buy. We believe the home improvement category is at best stagnant and potentially deteriorating ahead of difficult November and December comparisons. While we continue to believe the structural drivers of the home improvement category remain intact, the near-term setup is too challenging to maintain our positive stance. We have reduced our Home Depot and Lowe’s second-half 2025, fiscal 2026, and fiscal 2027 estimates to reflect a weaker second half of 2025 and a delayed category recovery. We are now meaningfully below consensus for both companies, and we do not believe buyside expectations fully appreciate the magnitude of potential revisions. We believe Home Depot’s fiscal third-quarter 2025 results and commentary will reveal weaker same-store sales performance relative to initial expectations, with the shortfall prompting scrutiny of Home Depot’s Complex Pro efforts, where the company has spent more than $20 billion on mergers and acquisitions ahead of the December Investor Day."

KeyBanc Earnings Preview of $NVDA (OW, $250 PT): 

"Expect Nvidia to report strong F3Q (Oct) results and guide F4Q (Jan) higher. We expect key drivers of upside to include: 1) Increasing shipments of B300, which should represent unit and ASP tailwinds; 2) Improving GB300 rack production, as we estimate FY26 rack shipments of 28K-30K; 3) Increasing Hopper production, which indicates NVDA may have resumed shipments to China. Conversely, we believe NVDA is capacity constrained, which could limit more meaningful upside and impact shipments of gaming GPUs. Accordingly, we're raising estimates slightly and reiterate our Overweight rating."

Telsey says Under Armour $UAA and Stephen Curry will split in 2026, with a 12 month wind down and the Curry 13 as the final shoe in February 2026, plus colorways and apparel running through October.

The Curry brand is expected to do about $100m to $120m in FY26, roughly 10% of UA footwear and 2% of total sales, so they do not see a big profit hit, but Curry has first rights on his signed athletes and could take them elsewhere, with Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Puma, Reebok, Anta and Li Ning all potential suitors.

Avadel $AVDL says it got an unsolicited takeover bid from Lundbeck worth up to $23 a share, versus up to $20 in its existing deal with Alkermes. 

The Lundbeck offer is 21 in cash plus up to 2 in CVRs tied to LUMRYZ and valiloxybate sales milestones. 

The board says the Lundbeck proposal could be a “superior offer” under its Alkermes agreement so they are allowed to engage with Lundbeck, but they are still officially backing the Alkermes deal for now.

Truist Securities Reiterates Buy Rating on $RDDT, PT $270

Analyst comments: "Following our investor group call with the company last week and subsequent conversations with investors, we are further focusing on key issues most relevant to the stock near- to medium-term. These include: (1) the debate around the potential for daily active user re-acceleration and increased user engagement driven by the new and improved onboarding process and the enhanced artificial-intelligence-powered search experience expected in fiscal year 2026; (2) the company’s ability to sustain highly elevated revenue growth through improvements in advertising monetization supported by end-to-end automation tools; and (3) the prospect for Reddit to show progress toward a 50% adjusted EBITDA margin now that it has achieved its prior 40% target ahead of plan (in the third quarter of 2025)."

Per Bloomberg, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves might extend the freeze on income tax thresholds in the upcoming Budget rather than lowering them. 

The fiscal gap is now put at about £20 billion after the latest forecast from the budget watchdog, and the Resolution Foundation estimates that keeping thresholds frozen in 2028 and 2029 would raise around £7.5 billion.

StubHub $STUB shares are under pressure after its 1st quarter as a public company. The company beat Q3 with $468m in revenue and about $67m in adj. EBITDA on GMS up 11% YoY to $2.44b, but gave NO forward guidance and only high level commentary, and analysts are cutting 4Q25 and 2026 estimates given tougher comps from Taylor Swift, last year’s World Series, and event calendar shifts that pulled more on sales into September.

JPMorgan Upgrades $MP to Overweight from Neutral, Lowers PT to $74 from $75

Analyst comments: "Following third-quarter results, we updated our MP model with Form 10-Q items and new accounting guidance for its landmark Department of Defense deal, including the $110 per kilogram neodymium-praseodymium price floor that took effect on October 1. Based on our revised estimates and mark-to-market pricing, we are upgrading the shares to Overweight with a slightly lower $74 price target for approximately 29% implied upside (versus the prior Neutral rating and $75 price target). Our new rating reflects our view that rare earths national security concerns are here to stay despite China’s reported one-year pause on export restrictions, with risks remaining—especially for military exposure. MP’s unique mine-to-magnet vertical integration positions the company as the ex-China leader ready to begin addressing these concerns immediately, though it will ultimately take multiple players many years to resolve them. Shares have come under pressure over the past month, falling 39% versus the S&P 500 and XME at +1% and –14%, respectively, and neodymium-praseodymium pricing at +2%, which we believe offers an attractive entry point."

very ugly premarkets

3 reasons it seems like the wind is getting taken out:

- no data transparency from October
- crypto de-leveraging
- AI capex trade fears 

last Friday, we had the shutdown headline to reverse the pain

today, I don’t know what headline reverses it unless the market simply thinks the selloff has become overdone

no one knows if that will happen or if the bottom continues to fall out, but margin calls/stop losses/forced liquidations all could contribute to a further hit until you have buyers and algos step in and begin buying 

important to just be liquid/solvent enough to last through a day like this if it does get worse

wild card is if Trump comes out and says something, only thing I can imagine is potentially more tariff reductions to ease prices but market may need more

US and UK companies have pulled back on FX hedging. 

A MillTech survey of 250 firms found average hedge ratios fell to 46% in Q3 from 57% in Q2, and average hedge length shortened to 5.8 months, even though over 90% of treasurers say they plan to increase hedge ratios next year and many still expect BoE and Fed rate hikes.

Wells Fargo Raises PT on $NVDA to $265 from $220 - Overweight

Analyst comments: "We slightly increase our near-term estimates, but more notably raise our fiscal year 2027 and fiscal year 2028 estimates given continued upside momentum in hyperscale capital expenditures. We now model fiscal year 2026, fiscal year 2027, and fiscal year 2028 at $209.2 billion / $4.61, $301.6 billion / $7.05, and $383.2 billion / $8.90, respectively (versus prior estimates of $208.9 billion / $4.60, $281.7 billion / $6.61, and $323.2 billion / $7.51). We increase our fiscal year 2026, fiscal year 2027, and fiscal year 2028 Data Center revenue estimates to $186.6 billion (+62% year over year), $276.4 billion (+48%), and $356.5 billion (+29%).

With our increased estimates and maintaining a consistent calendar year 2027 ~30x price-to-earnings multiple given NVIDIA's strong growth and best-in-class positioning for continued data center and artificial intelligence investments, we increase our price target to $265 (from $220). Our conversations suggest the upside calendar year 2027 earnings-per-share bogey has moved into the +$9 per share range (versus our current $8.90 estimate). NVIDIA’s supply ramp and its confidence and visibility into continued demand strength through 2026 and beyond remain key focus areas."

bulls have stepped in

the goal for today was to stop the bleeding

even if we end red, if it's not as bad as the premarkets, it's a win

anything else like an actual green close is a cherry on top

but dip buyers are trying to step in

U.S. dairy is putting about $11B into new processing plants across 19 states through 2028, but labor is the choke point. 

Farm labor is down ~7% since spring, immigrant workers make up roughly half the dairy workforce, and most year round jobs are shut out of H-2A. 

NMPF and IDFA warn that without visa reform a lot of this new capacity may end up underused.

In the Americas, JPMorgan $JPM, Bank of America $BAC, Berkshire $BRK and Citi lead, but the largest cash hoards are overseas, with Allianz and ICBC each holding close to $700B in cash and equivalents.

BofA on $NVDA (Buy, PT $275): 

"NVIDIA is the only merchant chip supplier with proven full-stack, rack-scale execution in large artificial intelligence cluster, first with Blackwell (GB200), then with Blackwell Ultra (GB300), and next year with Vera Rubin (VR), giving it three generations of experience by the second half of calendar year 2026. 

Cloud capital expenditure concerns tend to be seasonal (highest in the fourth quarter) and typically resolve when the new year begins and cloud customers provide their capex outlooks. 

NVIDIA’s valuation remains compelling at 27x and 21x price-to-earnings on our calendar year 2026 and calendar year 2027 estimates, essentially a market multiple for the leading franchise in the fastest global growth cycle, trading at roughly 0.6x calendar year 2027 price/earnings-to-growth versus the S&P 500 at about 2x. 

Our $275 price objective is now based on 30x calendar year 2027 estimates versus 44x calendar year 2026 estimates as we extend our model forward."

Trump is cutting tariffs on beef, tomatoes, coffee, bananas and hundreds of other foods the US does not produce in enough quantity, with the breaks backdated to Nov. 13 to help ease grocery costs. 

The move also rolls back a 10% reciprocal tariff on Brazilian farm goods, but a separate 40% punitive levy stays in place even after Brazilian coffee exports to the US fell more than 50% from August to October under the higher duties.
